ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face 
And it means something special to me 
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me 
How lucky can one fellow be? 
 
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine 
Who could ever believe that she could be mine? 
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue 
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do? 
 
And when we go for a walk in the park 
And she holds me and squeezes my hand 
We'll go on walking for hours and talking 
About all the things that we plan 
 
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine 
Who could ever believe that she could be mine? 
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue 
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?"

Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze

Let your body be the velvet of the night 
Touch my soul, you know how

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go 
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show 
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff 
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough 
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that 
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here 
Gotta have you near 
 
As good as new, my love for you 
And keeping it that way is my intention 
As good as new and growing too 
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension 
It's as good as new, my love for you 
Just like it used to be and even better 
As good as new, thank God it's true 
Darling, we were always meant to stay together 
 
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap 
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep 
How could I make such a dumb mistake 
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break 
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that 
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here 
Gotta get you near 
 
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again 
 
As good as new, my love for you 
And keeping it that way is my intention

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad 
And I've always been under your heel 
Holy christ what a lousy deal 
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways 
And I ain't gonna take it no more 
Oh no no - walkin' out that door 
 
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie 
Once again I wanna look into the eye 
Being myself 
Counting my pride 
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride 
Burning my bridges 
Moving at last 
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past 
Gonna have peace now 
You can be free 
No one here will make a sucker out of me"
ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting 
Staying alive though the city is dead 
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter 
While you are crying alone on your bed 
 
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you 
But then again you were lost from the start 
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets 
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts 
 
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood 
Now the last day is dawning 
Some of us wanted but none of us would 
Listen to words of warning 
But on the darkest of nights 
Nobody knew how to fight 
And we were caught in our sleep 
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe 
You really had the power 
I only saw it as dreams you would weave 
Until the final hour 
 
So in the morning your ship will be sailing 
Now that your father and sister are gone 
There is no reason for you to linger 
You're grieving deeply but still moving on 
 
You know the future is casting a shadow 
No one else sees it but you know your fate 
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough 
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait 
 
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood 
Now the last day is dawning 
Some of us wanted but none of us would 
Listen to words of warning 
But on the darkest of nights 
Nobody knew how to fight 
And we were caught in our sleep 
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe 
You really had the power 
I only saw it as dreams you would weave 
Until the final hour 
 
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise 
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain 
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure 
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain 
 
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood 
Now the last day is dawning 
Some of us wanted but none of us would 
Listen to words of warning 
But on the darkest of nights 
Nobody knew how to fight 
And we were caught in our sleep 
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe 
You really had the power 
I only saw it as dreams you would weave 
Until the final hour 
 
I'm sorry Cassandra 
I'm sorry Cassandra"
ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong 
You're enchained by your own sorrow 
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow 
How I hate to see you like this 
There is no way you can deny it 
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet 
 
Chiquitita, tell me the truth 
I'm a shoulder you can cry on 
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on 
You were always sure of yourself 
Now I see you've broken a feather 
I hope we can patch it up together 
 
Chiquitita, you and I know 
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving 
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end 
You will have no time for grieving 
Chiquitita, you and I cry 
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you 
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
Try once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
 
So the walls came tumbling down 
And your love's a blown out candle 
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle 
Chiquitita, tell me the truth 
There is no way you can deny it 
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet 
 
Chiquitita, you and I know 
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving 
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end 
You will have no time for grieving 
Chiquitita, you and I cry 
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you 
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
Try once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita 
Try once more like you did before 
Sing a new song, Chiquitita"
ABBA,Crazy World,/a/abba/crazy+world_20003013.html,"I was out with the morning sun 
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk 
I was thinking of you and me 
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk 
 
I could hardly believe my eyes 
When I saw this guy closing your front door 
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before 
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl 
 
Then I realized, it's a crazy world 
As he disapeared in his car 
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do 
Everything I had ever dreamed 
 
Everything in my life's part of you 
And I just couldn't move my feet 
So I stood on the pavement as you came out 
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about 
 
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl 
Then I realized, it's a crazy world 
Baby, how could you do it 
You just told me lies 
 
And you meet behind my back 
With other guys 
Baby, how could you tell me 
There was only me 
 
I was stupid to believe you 
I was blind but now I see 
Then you smiled and you took my hand 
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know 
 
There's a couple of men in my life 
And one of them is my brother Joe 
He's been gone for a long, long time 
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay 
 
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"" 
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl 
Then I realized, it's a crazy world 
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl 
 
Then I realized, it's a crazy world 
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl 
Then I realized, it's a crazy world"

Why did things turn out so bad? 
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had? 
 
Baby, give me one more 
Dance while the music still goes on

Dance and forget our time is gone 
Tonight's a night we borrow. 
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own 
A thing to remember when we're all alone 
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye 
 
Yes, all we have to do is 
Dance while the music still goes on 
This is no time for crying 
Dance, don't you hear them play our song 
God knows that we've been trying 
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same 
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame 
So dance while the music still goes on 
And let it be our last goodbye 
 
Yet it seems to make me sad. 
Why did things turn out so bad? 
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had? 
 
Baby, give me one last 
Dance while the music still goes on 
Just like the night I met you 
Dance and believe me, when you're gone 
You know I won't forget you 
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away 
You tell me it's over, what more can I say? 
So dance while the music still goes on 
It's gonna be our last goodbye 
 
Dance while the music still goes on

Looking out for the place to go 
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing 
You come in to look for a king 
Anybody could be that guy 
Night is young and the music's high 
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine 
You're in the mood for a dance 
And when you get the chance 
 
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen 
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine 
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life 
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen 
 
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on 
Leave them burning and then you're gone 
Looking out for another, anyone will do

You're all I had, you're all I want 
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have 
 
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows 
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd 
Thinking, wondering what you're doing 
I can't stop myself from crying out loud 
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar 
But then, they never shared our love

Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please 
 
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing 
I have questions and they know everything 
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher

Is it true I can spread my wings?

I remember long ago another starry night like this 
In the firelight Fernando 
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar 
I could hear the distant drums 
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar 
 
They were closer now Fernando 
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally 
I was so afraid Fernando 
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die 
And I'm not ashamed to say 
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry 
 
There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
 
Now we're old and grey Fernando 
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand 
Can you hear the drums Fernando? 
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande? 
I can see it in your eyes 
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night 
The stars were bright, Fernando 
They were shining there for you and me 
For liberty, Fernando 
Though I never thought that we could lose 
There's no regret 
If I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando 
 
Yes, if I had to do the same again 
I would, my friend, Fernando..."

Me recuerda tiempo atras 
Estrellas y una noche alla 
En la lumbre azul Fernando 
Tarareabas tu cancion 
Con ese suave guitarrear 
Yo podia escuchar 
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar 
 
Se acercaban mas fernando 
Y el momento que pasaba 
Parecia eternidad 
Y senti temor Fernando 
Por la vida y juventud 
Nadie pensaba en morir 
Y no siento hoy verguenza al 
Confesar que tuve 
Ganas de llorar 
 
Algo habia alrededor quiza 
De claridad Fernando 
Que brillaba por nosotros dos 
En proteccion Fernando 
No pensabamos jamas perder 
Ni echar atras 
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer 
Lo haria ya Fernando 
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer 
Lo haria ya Fernando 
 
La vejez llego Fernando 
Y con ella una paz 
Que hoy logramos disfrutar 
Se durmio el tambor Fernando 
Paraciera que fue ayer 
Que lo vivimos tu y yo 
Y en tus ojos veo aun 
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor. 
 
Algo habia alrededor quiza

Sitting here just waiting 
For next bus travelling 
Downtown 
It's a crying shame 
Isn't it 
The beautiful weather 
If I could have my way 
Well, I would not be working 
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be 
As free as a bumble bee 
Take a sip from 
Every flower 
Free as a bumble bee 
While away each lazy hour 
What a good life 
Lying laid back 
Like an old railroad bum by the track 
What a good life 
Living outdoors 
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw"
ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky 
Seems to me you shine your light 
Down to me to say goodnight 
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend 
Sleep is waiting round the bend 
While you travel through the milky way 
From afar 
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star. 
 
Raindrops on a window pane 
Stillness of a summer rain 
Silently the haze drifts through the trees 
Slowly dawn is breaking through 
Yet a morning without you 
 
Curtins rustling in the breeze 
I'm still trapped within my dreams 
Daylight makes it's way into my mind 
Coming through 
Yet another morning without you. 
 
Finally when darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace 
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes backs to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room 
 
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew 
 
Half awake in half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room. 
 
I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All too soon 
Like an angel passing through my room 
 
Long awaited darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace 
Dying embers warms my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room 
 
Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone 
How I hate to spend the evening on my own 
Autumn winds 
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room 
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom 
There's not a soul out there 
No-one to hear my prays 
 
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight 
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away 
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day 
 
Movie stars 
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win 
It's so different from the world I'm living in 
Tired of T. V. 
I open the window and I gaze into the night 
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight 
There's not a soul out there

And the memories filled with tears 
And I feel my heart will break 
Guess it all was my mistake 
 
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees 
The rain fell softly on your face 
Oh I remember every little thing about that day 
I remember every place 
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds 
The rain fell softly on your face 
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced 
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days"

ABBA,I Let The Music Speak,/a/abba/i+let+the+music+speak_20003002.html,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs 
No poet has ever painted 
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart 
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted 
I let the music speak with no restrains 
I let my feelings take over 
Carry my soul away, into the world 
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day 
 
Where my mind is like an open window 
Where the high and healing winds blow 
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me 
I let them take me 
 
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile 
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while 
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh 
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry 
 
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn 
Rustling down an old alley 
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man 
In some ancient valley 
I let the music speak, leading me gently 
Urging me like a lover 
Leading me all the way, into a place 
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day 
 
Where I'm one with every grand illusion 
No disturbance, no intrusion 
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me 
I let them use me 
 
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile 
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while 
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh 
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry 
 
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh 
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry 
 
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise 
Or the moment when a day dies 
I surrender without reservation 
No explanation, no questions why 
I take it to me and let it flow through me 
Yes, I let the music speak 
I let the music speak"

When I looked into my eyes 
'Cause something sure is wrong 
When this boy cries 
 
This boy cries 
 
I saw it in the mirror 
My head is hanging low 
And it ain't too familiar 
With the feelings that I show 
I know you say you love me 
But I'm looking through your lies 
It doesn't really bother you 
If this boy cries 
 
This boy cries 
 
I never thought I could cry for you 
But honey, I will miss you 
'Til the day I die

When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter 
 
You must have a lovelight 
Everything around you is lovelight 
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining) 
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)

Everything around you is lovelight 
You're shining like a star in the night (shining) 
I won't let you out of my sight (shining) 
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight 
 
How I remember the first time we went to movie 
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown 
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me 
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter 
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter 
 
You must have a lovelight 
Everything around you is lovelight 
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)

Blue since the day we parted

Mamma mia, now I really know 
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do 
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through"" 
And when you go, when you slam the door 
I think you know that you won't be away too long 
You know that I'm not that strong 
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring 
One more look and I forget everything

If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn 
Just as long as he pays the bill 
 
Did you see that man with a fat cigar 
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar 
He can choose the wine from a vintage year 
He will drink champagne in his limousine 
Where the rest of the street can peer 
 
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle 
Just like a spider in a cobweb 
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross 
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle 
He's never bothered by his conscience 
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be 
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle 
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle) 
 
But you see that man made a big mistake 
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake 
And the money too, all that he can spend 
He can buy the most, nearly anything 
But he can't buy the lot, his friend 
 
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle 
Just like a spider in a cobweb 
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross

And somewhere lies the answer 
To all the questions why 
What really makes the difference 
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

The crying of the seagulls that hover over me

But how can I explain 
The wonder of the moment 
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain 
 
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)

Our last summer 
Memories that remain 
 
We made our way along the river 
And we sat down in the grass 
By the Eiffel tower 
I was so happy we had met 
It was the age of no regret 
Oh yes 
Those crazy years, that was the time 
Of the flower-power 
But underneath we had a fear of flying 
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying 
We took the chance 
Like we were dancing our last dance 
 
I can still recall our last summer 
I still see it all 
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame 
Our last summer 
Walking hand in hand 
 
Paris restaurants 
Our last summer 
Morning croissants 
Living for the day, worries far away 
Our last summer 
We could laugh and play 
 
And now you're working in a bank 
The family man, the football fan 
And your name is Harry 
How dull it seems 
Are you the hero of my dreams 
 
I can still recall our last summer 
I still see it all 
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain 
Our last summer 
Memories that remain 
I can still recall our last summer 
I still see it all 
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame 
Our last summer 
Walking hand in hand 
Paris restaurants 
Our last summer 
Morning croissants 
Living for the day, worries far away..."

Should I laugh or cry

In the striped pyjamas that I bought

On his small philosophy 
Carries on the way he does 
 
And me I get so tired

And a sense of guilt I can't deny 
What happened to the wonderful adventures 
The places I had planned for us to go 
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't

I'm so grateful and proud 
All I want is to sing it out loud 
 
So I say 
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing 
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing 
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty 
What would life be? 
Without a song or a dance what are we? 
So I say thank you for the music 
For giving it to me 
 
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk 
She says I began to sing long before I could talk 
But I've often wondered, how did it all start? 
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart 
Like a melody can? 
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan 
 
So I say 
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing 
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing 
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty 
What would life be? 
Without a song or a dance what are we? 
So I say thank you for the music

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair 
I wanna sing it out to everybody

ABBA,The Day Before You Came,/a/abba/the+day+before+you+came_20002779.html,"I must have left my house at eight, because I always do 
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due 
I must have read the morning paper going into town 
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned 
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine 
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed 
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so 
The usual place, the usual bunch 
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained 
The day before you came 
 
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two 
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue 
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day 
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away 
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule 
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school 
The train back home again 
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then 
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame 
The day before you came 
 
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so 
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go 
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV 
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see 
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten 
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then 
I must have read a while 
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style 
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim 
The day before you came 
 
And turning out the light 
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night 
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain 
The day before you came"

And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces

Why should I complain.

Like I used to kiss you? 
Does it feel the same 
When she calls your name? 
Somewhere deep inside 
You must know I miss you 
But what can I say 
Rules must be obeyed

The likes of me abide 
Spectators of the show 
Always staying low

A big thing or a small

And I understand

If it makes you feel bad

No self-confidence

The winner takes it all 
The winner takes it all"

Traveling up the Nile 
Putting themselves on test 
Didn't that help the rest? 
Wasn't it worth it then? 
What about Livingstone? 
 
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand 
Didn't know what to answer or what to say

We fly instinctively 
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun 
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done 
 
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks 
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex 
We're still striving for the sky 
No taste for humble pie 
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun 
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done 
 
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor 
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more 
Clear-headed and open-eyed 
With nothing left untried 
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run 
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled 
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

One of these days 
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

When you get tired, you throw them away

Falling in love with a woman like you 
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do

Who am I 
And where do I flee? 
Who am I 
I'd like to remember 
Who am I 
And who do I want to be 
Who do I want to be 
Who am I 
And who do I want to be 
 
I went down to the river 
Trying to find peace in my mind 
In the throw 
I saw you glimmer 
The desire for you made me blind 
I first saw you at the distance 
When the moon's at its height 
I came to get to know you 
A disclosure so bright 
I knew, in my heart 
When your flair made me swoon 
I am just a prisoner 
In search of my tune 
 
Who am I 
What is the purpose 
Who am I 
From where do I flee? 
Who am I 
I'd like to remember 
Who am I 
And who do I want to be"

Here I am at camp granada 
Camp is very entertaining 
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining 
 
I went hiking with joe spivy 
He developed poison ivy 
You remeber leonard skinner 
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner 
 
All the counslers hate the waiters 
And the lake has alligators 
And the head coach wants no sissies 
So he reads to us from something called uylesses 
 
I don't want this, should I scare ya 
But my bunk mate has malaria 
You remember jeffery hardy 
They're about to organize a searching party 
 
Take me home, o mudda fudda 
Take me home, I hate granada 
Don't leave me out in the forest 
Where I might get eaten by a bear 
 
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise 
Or mess the house with other boys 
O please don't make me stay 
I've been here one whole day 
 
Dearest fadda, darling mudda 
How's my precious little brudda 
Let me come home, if you miss me 
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me 
 
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing 
Guys are swimming, gals are sailing 
Playing base ball, gee that's bedda 
Mudda fudda kindly disregard this letter!"

I just lit some crazy ass shit 
that my friend overnight mailed to me 
 
I'm fucking wasted 
It's the best shit I ever tasted 
I think they fucking laced it 
Cause I'm so damn lambasted 
 
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe 
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype 
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it 
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked 
 
He's fucking wasted 
It's the best shit he ever tasted 
He's lost in fucking spaced-ed 
Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted 
 
Oh I spent the last two hours 
hiding under my bed 
Cause I looked in the garbage can 
and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head 
 
I'm fucking wasted 
 
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face 
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place 
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak 
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak 
 
I'm fucking wasted 
It's the best shit I've ever tasted 
My brain's been erased-ed 
Well fucking fried 
 
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat 
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet 
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe 
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you 
 
I'm fucking wasted 
It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted

Will you eventually smoke weed? 
 
Soon enough you'll be walking 
You and me hand in hand 
The silly words you'll be talkin' 
Only daddy can understand 
We'll go out making snowmen 
Building castles in the sand 
And all the time I'm thinking, 
Will this kid end up smokin' weed? 
 
But time keeps on going 
And you keep on growin' 
You're now six years old 
You're getting so good at your spellin' 
But my mind is always dwellin' 
On the fact that you 
Could be the kind of guy 
Who grows up and needs 
To smoke weed on the couch 
All the time 
All the time 
 
So answer me this while 
You're lying in your little bed 
Why must you insist on bein' 
Such a fuckin' pothead? 
There's other things in life 
That can make you feel good 
But you just keep on smokin' your herb 
You can't get enough of 
Your precious, precious reefer 
Where you getting all this money 
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?"

You drift into my head 
And turn me into a crumbling fool. 
 
Tell me to run and I'll race, 
If you want me to stop I'll freeze, 
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby, 
And make me crazy for you.

Send me spinning closer to you.

Strips me down bare 
And gets me into my favorite mood.

The crazier I turn into.

Hoping you'll walk through 
And save me boy,

Old friend, why are you so shy 
Ain't like you to hold back 
Or hide from the light 
 
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I had hoped you'd see my face 
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over 
 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too, don't forget me 
I beg, I'll remember you say 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah 
 
You know how the time flies 
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives 
We were born and raised 
In a summer haze bound by the surprise 
Of our glory days 
 
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I hoped you'd see my face 
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over 
 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say 
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead 
 
Nothing compares no worries or cares 
Regrets and mistakes their memories made 
Who would have known how bittersweet 
This would taste 
 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say 
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead 
 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best for you too 
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say 
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead 
 
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

She was a tall whiskey glass 
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail 
Until I met a blind man 
Who taught me how to see 
A blind man 
Who could change night into day 
And if I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me 
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away 
 
I've had some lovers like a joy ride 
Some things are never what they seem 
My heaven's turned into a landslide 
I thank God I woke up from the dream 
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds 
The way bees chase honey 
And drink all the flowers dry 
We'll be saving us a little money 
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why 
Don't make no sense lightin' candles 
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

And a don't go burst the bubble 
On rich folks who get rude 
'Cause you won't get in no trouble 
When you eats that kinda food 
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds 
And then they go get stiff 
And they're dancin' in the yacht club 
With muff and uncle biff

When you toss your pearls to swine 
Their attitudes may taste like shit 
But go real good with wine

Full friction magazine 
I don't know how she do it 
 
Up down turnaround 
Four on the floor tonight 
When she did what she was doin' 
She was rubbin' me the wrong way right 
Push come to shove 
Give it one more try 
Don't miss your water 
Until the well runs dry 
 
Love Me Like A Birddog 
Never Learn to Fly 
 
Bareback baby 
Tell me what's on your mind 
If it's the same old same old 
Slap you on the back behind 
I don't know how you do it 
Tell me one time 
About how it used to be 
You got the judge and jury 
Swinging from the highest tree 
Push came to shove 
Give it one more try 
Don't miss your water 
Until the well runs dry 
 
Love Me Like a Bird Dog 
Never learn to fly 
Ask me no questions 
I'll tell you no lies 
 
Love Me Like a Bird Dog 
Never learn to fly 
Ask me no questions 
 
Bass drum beating 
Like a hot damn house on fire 
Love lover's quarrels 
Always seem to make the body cry

Tell me one time 
About how it used to be

Swinging from the highest tree 
Push came to shove 
Give it one more try

Until the well runs dry

You find you don't know jack... yeah 
So much for mind games you play to win 
'Cuz first you lose your heart's desire 
Then you get it back 
But ignorance ain't bliss 
There's so much more behind the kiss...I'm feelin' 
I imagine everyone sometimes 
Will cross their heart and hope to die 
To tell I love you lies 
I imagine everyone survives 
For giving up all that you got 
To tell I love you lies 
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me 
God help the person...fff...who needs me...yeaah 
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list 
I'm leaving

Aerosmith,Melt Down,/a/aerosmith/melt+down_20004496.html,"The streets were cold and barren 
The nights were dark and dank 
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years.... 
The buildings were dead and the alleys 
Stunk from things that used to live there 
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered 
 
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his 
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence 
With not a scrap left on the plate 
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable 
Cause the only thing left was their faith 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do 
About it.... 
 
There's a Meltdown in the sky 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 
There's a fear that gets me high 
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by.... 
 
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold 
Made me wonder just who was the foe 
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus 
Had predicted such a long long time ago? 
You could hear screams and moanin' 
From the people atoning 
For their sins of a guilt ridden life 
And the final door shuts 
From the wind that leaves cuts 
From the edge on the blade of God's knife 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about.... 
 
There's a Melt Down in the Sky 
There's a new day comin and I don't know why 
There's a tear stuck in my eye 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 
 
Battle lines had been drawn 
Mother nature how she cried 
By her side, till the dawn 
Couldn't kill her if they tried 
How they tried, open eyed, genocide 
Then... She died

You stop it at the door

Time's too short 
The fire's too hot 
Don't know what to do 
'Cause I know in a flash 
It's just a memory too

Another empty day

However would she let him go? 
And when the time it came upon them, 
She said in case we forget... 
 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
 
The letters came and every single Sunday 
We all would wait to hear the news. 
She knew her love would be home someday, 
The only thing she held on to. 
We sang a song just like we used to 
And she said before we could leave... 
 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
 
That night she heard her true love calling 
With words that only she could know. 
They held each other till the morning 
And when it was his time to go. 
She said... 
 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more. 
 
Just a little bit more."

And when the seats are empty 
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight 
And I'll be in the place where I belong 
 
For who will tell the story 
Except someone like me 
Of tragedy and glory 
Of lovers as they walk so blindly 
And try to find a place where they belong 
We all must find a place where we belong 
 
Everybody knows me 
Everone shows me 
And I'll be here when you have gone 
For the road to carry on 
We all must find a place where we belong 
 
If destiny has spoken 
If finally the dawn has broken 
We all must find a place where we belong

I'll turn and walk into my spotlight

That after all 
The times you told me that we'd never be good together 
After all the things you said 
That made me think that you'd never call 
Now you've turned around and told me 
That you want to stay here forever

Wasn't cause it wasn't there

To believe 
That you'd go

Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame. 
Because I'm too tired to run around 
Meeting people from the wrong side of town 
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money nothing to give, listen 
All you gotta do is look around for something that's new 
find a job that's stimulating, that's easy and I'm still waiting

With nothin' to do all day 
I've stood in line with all my friends 
With nothin' to say all day, 
I've stood in line and done my time 
With nothin' to do all day 
I've stood in line with all my friends 
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day. 
Got brains but got no drive 
Money's cheap, the roads are wide 
All the good positions go too fast 
I need a job I know will last 
I've got a job for you can you push that shovel can you swing that broom 
Keep your head down and don't go slow 
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.

And said that I can't hold on

They swore they would change it 
with loving and shareing 
They'll never live like their parents have done 
Their innocence shone like the sun

American hearts, so easily broken

He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills 
And she has trouble sleeping 
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh 
 
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers 
Now they've got nothing to say to each other 
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes 
They filed for divorce and it breaks their

Ah - American hearts 
Ah - American hearts, American hearts 
 
Now that it's over they'll each go on living 
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving 
They'll care for their children protect them with pride 
And that's how their dream will survive in

There's nothing she can say 
 
Nothing that anyone can do 
And so she lets me live it through 
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty 
She just simply lets me be 
And goes right on loving me 
 
[Chorus: x2] 
And when it seems my dreams 
Have all slipped through my fingers 
When they just can't be found 
I turn around and there they are 
Shining in her eyes"
Air Supply,Crazy Love,/a/air+supply/crazy+love_20522279.html,"When you are young, the thought of the day is 
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules. 
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that 
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last. 
And you smile as it's going past. 
Each morning arrives, and so much is new 
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you. 
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night 
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins. 
 
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all 
Watching time, all the things that you need so much 
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love 
 
You live every day, as fast as it comes 
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way. 
These times will change, and people must grow but 
Until you do, you live the only life that you know 
And the wild fire lets you go. 
 
There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes, 
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew 
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love. 
 
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all 
Watching time, all the things that you need so much 
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love"

Feel the rhythm walking on air 
Feel like dancing with the mountain

Footsteps on higher ground

I should have known before 
Her love for me was gone

You surely gave me something new

Could break what I hold for you 
I know the cut will never be mine

Waiting to put a foot in the door 
Hoping to learn what you're never sure

All the friends that I can think of 
Know what's going to happen to them

Buried deep inside for only us to find

All that lay within you, 
As this dawn should break 
With this force awoken, none can stand before 
This is the hour, now is the time 
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine 
All that we must be, is everything we see

So on finding out the name of the game

The same car with a different mind 
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place

As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you 
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too 
Let's take a chance at least we'll learn a lesson 
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days 
I don't want to love you in two different ways 
 
Do you want to give, do you want to give me you whole day and more 
Do you want to give, do you want always the key to the door 
It's easy for you talking your way out of all situations 
When you can't see thru' and leave it up to me 
And that's what I do 
And that's what I do 
 
 
Love comes to me and leaves me with you 
Love runs thru' me in all that you do 
Don't walk away, don't leave me standing here 
That's not the way, don't lead me anywhere 
I need you now, I need you now 
Don't leave me standing here 
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know 
It's much too fast for me can't we go slow

And they reward me with love 
And see I have a good time. 
So all my moves must be fast 
'cause every day is my last 
A secret agent that's slow 
Almost certain to go. 
 
(chorus) 
I've got friends in the states 
I've got friends out in space 
When information's your game 
The whole world knows your name 
And so they gave me a code 
To work this treacherous road 
For all the agents I know 
Must work incognito.

Air Supply,Shadow Of The Sun,/a/air+supply/shadow+of+the+sun_20522267.html,"Across the concrete sky come walk with me 
Something we need to know 
Something we need to see 
Is it love, yes its love 
Only love that is growing inside me 
If it's love, yes it's love 
Only love, is the pillar of plenty 
 
You, you make me feel, this is all I need 
And it's all so real 
You help me understand, where I want to be 
When I touch your hand 
 
I can see to the shadow of the sun 
We can be in the shadow of the sun 
 
Untie the sails, the shore will melt away 
Without a trace, I hear the raven say 
When it's love, this is love, when it's love 
That we must know we must enter 
This is love, this is love, only love 
When the dove is descended 
 
You are the winding stream going to somewhere 
That we' ve never seen 
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream 
And the final prayer 
 
I can see to the shadow of the sun 
We can be in the shadow of the sun 
Reach out for the shadow of the sun 
Cry out for the shadow of the sun 
You are the colors of the wind 
Singing hopes, eternal spring 
In a symphony for every lonely year 
You are the keeper of the key 
And the one that longs to be 
The light for each and every frozen tear

The air was still, the words would flow 
We knew each other oh so well 
And though just met you'd never tell 
Sometimes we're just lonely hearts 
That ride upon a floating card 
Prepared to live those sleepless nights 
For precious time in paradise 
And now I find the future's gone 
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone 
I tried for it all 
She never heard me call at all 
There's no regrets, we made the choice 
We listened to that silent voice 
That haunts you 'til you just give in 
And makes you like a child again 
We drifted close then said goodbyes 
Just reading well each other's eyes 
The world had turned while we stood still 
And held on to each other 
And in between the right and wrong 
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong 
I tried for it all 
She never heard me call 
And now I find the future's gone 
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone 
I cried for it all 
She never heard me call at all "

We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman 
Until the other kids knock him down

Though your nose gets chillin' 
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way

To the one you do belong 
So glad we met and you stayed 
Though it wasn't very long 
Was it only just a dream 
It's over now it seems 
If there were no goodbyes 
Would you stay that you still care 
I won't believe my eyes 
When I see you won't be there 
'Cause this love so hard to find 
Now you're leavin' me behind 
Oh please 
 
CHORUS: 
Show me and tell me 
How do you put this love aside 
(And) Put it away for another time 
With no guarantee that you'll be mine 
A fool I am it seems 
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams 
Until I wake up and I find out 
That time ain't our friend 
I'll just stay a fool till the end 
 
(Till the end, I'll be a fool) 
(Till I find it's me and you) 
If it only was game 
Why'd you have to fool my heart 
Oh girl ain't it a shame 
That we promised from the start 
That our love was here to stay 
For each and everyday 
If I had only known 
And if I didn't have to care 
Then being all alone 
It wouln't be so hard to bear 
This love so hard to find 
That we're leavin' here behind 
Oh please

I maybe over acting 
I know I must stay strong 
But you pulled the string too hard 
And now we're going on our own

You know I just stay a fool"

I turn to him and he kisses me 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes

Alabama,Christmas In Your Arms,/a/alabama/christmas+in+your+arms_20005047.html,"All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays 
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways 
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm 
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms 
 
[Chorus:] 
We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow 
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow 
I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm 
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms 
 
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart 
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart 
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree 
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me

I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms"

There I stood in another line 
Tryin to buy that last gift or two 
Not really in the Christmas mood 
 
Standin right in front of me 
Was a little boy waiting anxiously 
Pacing round like little boys do 
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes 
 
And his clothes were worn and old 
He was dirty from head to toe 
And when it came his time to pay 
I couldn't believe what I heard him say 
 
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes 
For my mama, please 
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size 
Could you hurry, sir? 
Daddy says theres not much time 
You see, shes been sick for quite a while 
And I, know these shoes will make her smile 
And I, want her to look beautiful 
If mama meets Jesus tonight 
 
He counted pennies for what seemed like years 
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here. 
He searched his pockets franticly 
Then he turned and he looked at me 
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house 
Most years she just did without 
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do 
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes 
 
So I laid the money down 
I just had to help him out 
And Ill never forget the look on his face 
When he said Mamas gonna look so great 
 
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes 
For my mama, please 
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size 
Could you hurry, sir? 
Daddy says theres not much time 
You see, shes been sick for quite a while 
And I, know these shoes will make her smile 
And I, want her to look beautiful 
If mama meets Jesus tonight 
 
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven love 
As he thanked me and ran out 
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me 
What Christmas is all about

For my mama, please

Lies one that I love so well

Disturb not her rest in the vale

Oh, come to the church in the vale 
No spot is so dear to my childhood 
As the little brown church in the vale 
 
There close by the site of that loved one 
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom 
When farewell hymns shall be chanted 
I shall rest by her side in the tomb

It was me she was telling good-bye

Give me the chance to tell her I still care 
Get her back on the line, tell her I'm still in love 
Said, ""sorry son, but you're breaking up""

Made sweet music for a while

Nights he went to G.I. school 
He didn't know nothin' 'bout the silver spoon 
But he lived by the golden rule 
 
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home 
Out on the front porch swing 
Wishin' on the stars in the southern sky 
And sometimes we used to sing 
 
We were leaning, leaning on 
The everlasting arms of love 
Livin' all those simple joys 
This Dixie boy is made of 
 
Got my real education from the T.V. station 
And good ole boys down at the park 
The say ""Hey, Willie"" and those rock-a-billies 
Made their way into my heart

On laidback Sunday afternoons 
They said them young folks sure got a hard road 
Oh, they're growin' up too soon 
 
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight 
Out on the front porch swing 
The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes

there's only one that remains

Dixie fire it never leaves me whole 
It took a hometown girl to show me 
How cruel these hot summer nights can be 
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me 
Burning in the heart of me 
 
Searching for some kind of direction, 
Looking for a guiding light 
Needed to see a lighthouse, 
Like a ship on a stormy night 
Somehow you heard my music, 
You felt the sadness in me 
You took the words that were so cold, 
And added a warm melody

Alabama,Fireworks,/a/alabama/fireworks_10003929.html,"There are people in this country who work hard every day 
Not for fame or fortune do they strive 
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay 
And it's time a few of them were recognized 
Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time 
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line 
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time 
You work a forty hour week for a livin', a-just to send it on down the line 
This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail 
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale 
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail 
For everyone who works behind the scenes 
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields 
In the city streets and the quiet country towns 
Working together like spokes inside a wheel 
They keep this country turning around 
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time 
You work a forty hour week for a livin',a-just to send it on down the line 
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time 
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line 
This is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road 
Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load 
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol 
For everyone who works behind the scenes 
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine 
Hello America let me thank you for your time "

And felt the love in mamma's hands, 
They kept us warm and kept us fed, 
Taught us how to look ahead, 
Now lookin' back I understand.

Those fertile fields are never far away, 
We were walkin' in high cotton,

When Sunday mornings rolled around, 
We dressed up hand-me-downs, 
Just in time to gather with the church, 
Some times I think how long It's been, 
And how it impressed me then, 
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

My emotions interfere 
So I write it a little,

Can't be with you 
I would kiss you oh so good

Let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight, 
I'll keep the pedal to the floor till we see the morning light. 
They can't live our lives for us, 
If we let them we'll lose our love. 
And love dies hard in this Texas sun, 
I'd rather be reckless and on the run

Let the wind blow through our hair

Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight

Burn the bridge and don't look back.

Baby we're gettin' out of here 
Roll the windows down.

I played for tip and watered drinks 
Just a novice in a business 
That's seldom what it seems 
 
And where are you goin' tar top 
Where's J.C. and the chosen few? 
I saw the flash without T.Gentry 
And B.V. left for Malibu

When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time 
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too 
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes 
 
But in the Bowery hangs the memories 
Of dreams that still come true 
Every time I see the spotlights 
I'm one of the chosen few 
 
And where are you going tar top

There's no flash without T.Gentry

About the music that you make?

A symphony in the night 
Of stars that dance in the light 
And music far away 
 
They say that love is but a dance 
Don't let the music fade away 
Don't let the moment pass 
 
Without reason or rhyme 
The sweet bouquet of the wine 
Will vanish in the air 
 
The innocence of the rose 
She leaves where she goes 
For all the world to share 
 
Some days when clouds are drifting by 
I open my eyes and watch them go 
And wonder where they fly 
 
Some nights orion runs too fast 
I look to the stars as if to say 
Don't let the moment pass 
 
But soon a golden age is past 
Just when it seemed that miracles 
Where not too much to ask 
 
And though the world may turn too fast 
If it should seem like paradise 
Don't let the moment pass"

Maybe there is really nothing there at all 
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me 
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall 
 
When my back is turned he's up to something else 
And I must not stop believing in myself 
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on 
And never end 
 
Somebody out there, says that he's you 
Somebody out there, talks like you do 
He calls up your number 
And you can't get through somebody out there 
 
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me 
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say 
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me 
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away 
 
And I don't need more confusion in my life 
No more pain and disillusion in my life 
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on 
And never end 
 
Somebody out there, using your name 
Somebody out there, you get the blame 
There's doubt and suspicion 
It's hard to explain somebody out there 
 
And I don't need more confusion in my life 
No more pain and disillusion in my life 
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on 
And never end 
 
Somebody out there, stolen your base 
Somebody out there, parked in your space 
You've no reservation, he's taken your place 
Somebody out there, wasting your time 
Somebody out there, using your dime 
Your friends think you're crazy 
They're way out of line 
Somebody out there, says that he's you 
Somebody out there, thinks like you do 
You stare at the mirror 
You're looking into 
Somebody out there "

Don't get your head into a spin

The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye 
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time 
May the games begin the best man win

Is it the fool that wont let it show 
 
Free yourself

You know there is the only place to go 
And when you've had enough of fighting 
And every mean trick under the sun 
But still you fear the worst is yet to come 
Take the money and run 
 
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground 
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found 
But watch your step the ice is thin 
If only you could see the mess you're in 
 
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one 
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done 
It matters not you're lost to him 
If only you could see the mess you're in

Is it the fool that wont let it show?

As they fall from your open hand 
At the call of the wind's command 
 
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say 
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way 
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you 
 
All that I ask you 
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey 
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way 
Let me see the light, let me be the light 
 
As the sun turns slowly around the sky 
Till the shadow of night is high 
The eagle will learn to fly 
 
As the days of his life are but grains of sand 
As they fall from your open hand 
And vanish upon the land 
 
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say

To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you 
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey

(I) Prelude 
 
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am 
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite 
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension 
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined 
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music. 
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes 
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment 
motionless.""

And through my sleeping 
I heard a tapping at my door 
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness 
And so I turned inside once more 
To my amazement 
There stood a raven 
Whose shadow hung above my door 
Then through the silence 
It spoke that one word 
That I shall hear forever more 
Nevermore 
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore 
And still the raven remains in my room 
No matter how much I implore 
No words can soothe him 
No prayer remove him 
And I must hear for evermore 
Quoth the raven, nevermore

Promises to keep more than any other

The ring is power 
Like a candle in the dark for everyone to see

The ring is fire 
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun 
 
In a circle 
Living in a world of perpetual motion 
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean 
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion 
Ridin on a wild carrousel 
You'll be turning round and round 
Round and round we go 
 
Promises, promises, promises, promises 
 
Round your finger 
After all the years we've been together 
Walking in the sun and stormy weather 
Sharing in a moment to last forever 
Memories and dreams without end 
 
The ring is magic 
The ring is power 
And it finds you in the darkness of the night 
The ring is madness 
The ring is fire 
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light

You drink the wine 
You play the fool 
You cross the line 
You lose your cool 
But no one cares 
Still no one cares 
 
You raise the bar 
Lost in a trance 
One bridge too far 
No second chance 
But no one cares 
Still no one cares 
 
We play the game 
We hold our own 
We fight to win 
We stand alone 
 
You had a dream 
You cast the dice 
Your shady scheme 
You paid the price 
But no one cares 
Still no one cares 
 
We play the game 
With hearts of stone 
You lose again 
You're on your own 
 
A turning tide 
A streak of light 
Arms open wide 
The end's in sight 
And someone cares 
Yes someone cares 
 
We play the game 
We hold our own 
We fight to win 
We stand alone"

On an ocean deep

Lyin' on the floor

I made friends with a lot of people

See my lonely mind explode

Said to myself this is very strange 
I'm glad it wasn't me

You better take me home, 
Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise, 
And I'm still on my own, own"

I wish I could give you something you didn't owe 
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile 
And I could be with you awhile 
 
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for 
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door 
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile 
And I could be with you awhile 
 
I just want to take you somewhere you haven't been 
Find an old time movie where we don't know the end 
Lost in the radio, drive another mile 
So I could be with you awhile 
 
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for 
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door 
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile 
And I could be with you awhile 
 
Tired of serious conversation 
Tangled up in situations 
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me 
 
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for 
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor 
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile 
And I could be with you awhile 
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for 
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door 
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile 
And I could be with you awhile 
I just want to be with you awhile 
I just want to be with you awhile 
I just want to be with you...."

Drown my sorrow 
Kill my pain

Save a child 
Raise a million bucks 
That'll last a while 
Fight at parties 
Buy a horse 
Lose a couple 
Win that big divorce 
 
I want to be in the headlines 
Anything to be in the headlines 
 
Saw my chance 
Made my break 
Took the biggest float 
In the Rose parade 
Got jailed 
No disgrace 
A hundred million people 
Saw my face 
 
Called a conference 
With the press 
Announced my marriage plans 
In a wedding dress 
Climb a building 
At six-below 
On New Year's Eve 
Without a stitch of clothes 
 
I want to be in the headlines 
Anything to be in the headlines 
As long as they spell my name right 
I hope that they catch my best side 
 
Popped out 
From a cake 
At the President's ball 
What a big mistake 
Fifty guns 
Aimed at me 
I was nearly killed 
But what publicity 
Nominated 
Something big 
Stole the hottest scene 
Says the Globe And Trib 
Porno movie 
Comes to light 
But I was starving then 
So that's alright 
 
I want to be in the headlines 
Anything to be in the headlines 
 
As long as the spell my name right 
Hope that they catch my best side 
Keep my sidewalk status star bright 
Feel free to walk on me tonight 
Just don't spit on me 
 
Headlines, headlines 
Headlines, headlines 
Headlines, headlines

Did you see that face 
Or was it just a dream 
It can't be real

Get away if you can

Going to make his rounds to get his fill 
Standing staight and tall 
He's a ton of fun 
And he's dressed to kill

Emptiness has left no doubt

Like my boots were full of glue

Near the cliff up on the mountain 
When an unexpected sneeze 
Hung me in the breeze 
At forty five degrees in the sky 
Suddenly I felt something 
Had me by the belt 
And in between my praying 
Swore I heard a stallion neighing 
Was the ghost of my horse 
And I cried, yes I cried 
 
That was the day 
My dead pet returned to save my life

My dead pet returned to save my life

Got caught on territory 
Belonging to the Crutches 
In an alley in their clutches 
Looking kind of dismal that night 
Well the leader's name was Fats 
Swinging broken baseball bats 
Things got really frantic 
Starting jumping in their panic 
Hallucinating billions of rats 
Lots of rats 
 
That was the day 
My dead pet returned to save my life 
That was the day 
My dead pet returned to save my life 
I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive

It pulled me right out of a dream 
If I knew it was you 
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream 
 
I am the one who growls in your closet 
I am the one who lives under your bed

Get down, back where you started 
Get down, back into hell 
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted 
I smell your sulfurous smell 
 
All of my things that I play with in daylight 
You turn into monsters at night 
My toys were my friends 
Until you taught them all how to bite 
 
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see 
You scared me with visions of fire 
You danced on my bed 
With the flames on your head dancing higher 
 
I am the one who growls in your closet 
I am the one who lives under your bed

I don't want your reptile embrace

Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face

I'm awake anyway

I'm laughing. That's tight as shit, what are you talkin' about?"

Wicked pleasures, sins of flesh and blood

Sipping on my cup all day 
Stone cold bitch you're ballin'

And you get yourself in line

He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights 
They remind him, of nights long ago, 
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred, 
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees, 
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold 
[Chorus:] 
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay 
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away 
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood, 
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love 
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear 
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves 
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride 
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold

Take the beet from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine 
Just to place on your table your that light, sparkling wine"

Alison Krauss,That Kind Of Love,/a/alison+krauss/that+kind+of+love_20316764.html,"Who would sell their soul for love 
Or waste one tear on compromise? 
Should be easy enough 
To know a heartache in disguise 
But the heart rules the mind 
And the going gets rough 
Pride takes the fall 
When you find that kind of love 
 
I can't help feeling like a fool 
Since I lost that place inside 
Where my heart knew its way 
And my soul was ever wise 
Once innocence was lost 
There was not faith enough 
Still my heart held on 
When it found that kind of love 
 
Though beauty is rare enough 
Still we trust 
Somehow we'll find it there 
With no guarantee 
It seems to me 
At least it should be fair 
 
But if it's only tears and pain 
Isn't it still worth the cost 
Like some sweet saving grace 
Or a river we must cross 
If we don't understand 
What this life is made of 
We learn the truth 
When we find that kind of love 
Cause when innocence is lost 
There is not faith enough 
We learn the truth 
When we find that kind of love"

Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul 
How he brought salvation and he made me whole 
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart 
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire 
When God dips his love in my heart

And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal 
I go to God in prayer, I can always find him there 
To whisper sweet peace to my soul

And gave his life completely to bring a better day 
My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in

Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin 
When the lights are low, and when it's time to go, 
I need your love so bad. 
So give it up, and bring it on home to me. 
Oh you can write it on a paper so it can be read to me. 
Tell me you love me, stop drivin' me mad, 
Cause I need your love so bad. 
I needed some voice, to take me through the night, 
Don't you worry baby, I will not fuss and fight. 
Well listen to my plea, now bring it on home to me, 
Cause I need your love so bad. 
Well, I need your love soooo bad. 
Soooo bad. So baaad. Soooooo bad."

Transcribed by sam carle 
 
Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster, 
Closing in, 
And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling, 
Wondering why and where I've been, 
Just about the time, I think I can't hold on, 
You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say, 
 
I never knew how much a man needed a woman 
(no I never) 
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl 
(needed a girl) 
I never knew how much I needed you 
 
Day after day I join the rat race, 
Tryin' to make the most of it, 
I keep on falling down down the ladder, 
Still trying to stay on top of it, 
Just when I was sure, 
Nothing could get no better, 
Oh I realize, 
I still love you more than ever, 
 
[Chorus:] 
 
Today I watch the sun set on the freeway, 
Strangled on the poison air, 
But miles beyond, on the other end, 
I know, you'll always be waiting there, 
Girl you treat me, 
With your kindest hand, 
And in my heart, in my mind, 
And I'm so glad

Now you just tell me what you want 
And then sign on this line

Man I want a continnetial spare and some white chrome wheels 
And power steering and uh a power brakes 
And a powerful motor with a jet off take 
Some nice cool air condition and some nice warm heat 
And a big old feather bedroom pillow in the back seat

So I can talk to my honey while I'm riding alone

Between her fine perfume and angel face, 
My whole world became another place. 
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong, 
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong. 
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door. 
I could not wait to hear the siren song, 
The beginning of the end of my happy home. 
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo,

Heard them say the payback's double-fold, 
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold. 
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year, 
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole. 
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old. 
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo, 
Too blind in love, too blind to see. 
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox, 
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop. 
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul, 
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.

I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past, I forgive the stars
when they fell too fast 
I forgive the joke that it didn't make me laugh, I forgive desire that I had
to starve 
I forgive all the love for the sake of love, I forgive all sakes for the fake
above 
For the sake of love, for the sake of love 
For the sake of love"
Alphaville,Forever Young,/a/alphaville/forever+young_20006842.html,"Let's start in style, let's dance for a while, 
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies. 
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst, 
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not? 
 
Let us die young or let us live forever 
We don't have the power, but we never say never 
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip 
The music's for the sad man. 
 
Can you imagine when this race is won? 
Turn our golden faces into the sun, 
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune 
The music's played by the madman. 
 
Forever young, 
I want to be forever young. 
Do you really want to live forever? 
Forever, and ever 
 
Forever young, 
I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever? 
Forever young. 
 
Some are like water, some are like the heat 
Some are a melody and some are the beat 
Sooner or later they all will be gone 
Why don't they stay young? 
 
It's so hard to get old without a cause 
I don't want to perish like a fading horse 
Youth's like diamonds in the sun, 
And diamonds are forever 
 
So many adventures couldn't happen today, 
So many songs we forgot to play 
So many dreams swinging out of the blue 
Oh let them come true 
 
Forever young, 
I want to be forever young. 
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, and ever? 
 
Forever young, 
I want to be forever young. 
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever young?

that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from 
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways 
and angels burn to dust before the human race 
we're giants under a rainbow 
we're stranded east of eden 
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow 
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them 
freedom that is what you are always screaming 
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh 
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming 
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance 
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies 
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die

And silence was our friend 
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes 
The struggle and the strife and the black and white 
And all the letters that we wrote 
Would be printed out in gold 
In our memories to behold 
Without explanations 
To be told... 
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say 
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew 
I saw u bachstage in that chair 
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair 
And then I took you by the hand and off we went 
And we just drank to quench our thirst 
That never dies and always burns 
Deep in the night out on the streets 
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do 
And all the poems that we wrote 
Would be printed out in gold 
In our memories to behold 
Without explanations 
To be told...

I sometimes catch him floating in his swimming-pool

On a quest for the valley of boojums

Caught in a kind of radio-beacon

Transmitting them backwards

With a move in your face, 
Do I still walk on the same structure? 
Hey, what do we know

Nothing is real 
Even iron or steel 
Melting gently in the cold structure 
Watching your face thru' a peephole 
As I lean against the door 
Can't understand what you say 
But I think that you're calling my name 
Leaving the ones I loved is like 
Leaving the one they want me to be 
Making decisions 
In real-time-precision 
As millions of sailors 
In parallelworlds

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love

Places to hide in the dusty gloom 
A noisy clock and a silver spoon 
A china cup on the mantlepiece 
Gathering dust as it did in the east 
And just outside lies the garden of peace 
Oh, tell me is this really true 
Can it be, peace has come to me and you 
Tell me over, over and over 
Tell me is this really happening 
Inside this world it's beautiful 
Peace in this garden has come true 
A mirror pond reflects the dawn 
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn 
A breeze has come and I'm carried along 
So follow the path through the knowing trees 
And each time you laugh, it is love you release 
That love will come back in the garden of peace 
So, tell me is this really true 
Can it be, peace has come to me and you 
Tell me over, over and over 
Tell me is this really happening

Are you going to see them on the mountain now 
Goin' to see them trees 
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow

I like them always, they're a laughing crowd 
To catch the wind then come slidin' down

Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles 
Brushin' every curl back again

The smell of evergreen 
As special as it's always been 
And I have a dream or two 
Maybe they will come true 
 
[Chorus:] 
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight 
We'll wake up to a world of white 
It's gonna be a christmas to remember 
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole 
Always sentimental and don't you know that 
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember 
 
I know it's true 
Time doesn't stand still 
Many things can change 
But we know some things never will 
The memories we share 
The songs we always sing 
The mystery of life 
The hopefulness this season brings 
And I have a dream or two 
Maybe they will come true 
 
[Chorus:]"
Amy Grant,Abide With Me,/a/amy+grant/abide+with+me_20708448.html,"Abide with me, fast falls the eventide 
The darkenss deepens, Lord, with me abide 
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee 
Help of the helpless, O abide with me 
 
I need Thy presence every passing hour 
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power? 
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? 
Through cloud and sunshine, o abide with me 
 
Abide, with me 
Abide, abide with me 
 
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless 
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness 
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, Thy victory? 
I triumph still if Thou abide with me 
 
Abide , with me 
Abide, abide with me 
Abide, with me 
Abide, abide with me"

After the ashes cool 
After the smoke is blown away 
I will be is for you 
After the stillness finds you 
After the winds of change 
All that is good and true between us 
This will remain the same 
Slowly, slowly 
We turn the pages of life 
Growing, knowing 
It comes at quite a price 
After the fire is over 
After the ashes cool 
After the smoke is blown away 
I will be here for you 
After your time of wondering 
Along this lonely road 
There will be many voices calling 
Mine will say welcome home 
Slowly, slowly 
We turn the pages of life 
Growing, knowing 
It comes at quite a price 
After the fire is over 
After the ash is cool 
After the smoke is blown away 
I will be here for you 
I will be here for you

Amy Grant,Ageless Medley,/a/amy+grant/ageless+medley_20007735.html,"Are you living in an old man's rubble? 
Listening to the father of lies? 
If you are then you're headed for trouble. 
Listen too long, you'll eventually die. 
 
Too late for walking in the middle, 
Too late to try. 
And it's too late for sitting in the balance, 
No more middle line. 
 
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving? 
You wonder why you do the things you do? 
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance? 
It feels like something's got a hold on you. 
 
Are you living in an old man's rubble? 
Listening to the father of lies? 
If you are then you're headed for trouble. 
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die. 
 
When I'm losing my sense of direction, 
And I'm needing some strength and protection, 
Walking away with You. 
I go walking away with You, and when I, 
When I think I can't stand any longer, 
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger, 
Walking away with You. 
I go walking away with You. 
 
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, 
El-Elyon na Adonai, 
Age to age, You're still the same, 
By the power of the name. 
 
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, 
Erkamka na Adonai, 
I will praise and lift You high, 
El Shaddai. 
 
I'm gonna fly. 
No one knows where, 
But I'm gonna fly. 
I'm lighter than air. 
 
And I'm gonna fly. 
No one knows where, 
But I'm gonna fly, 
And soar through the air. 
 
'Cause I have felt for the first time, 
I can be myself, 
No more faces to hide behind, 
Just a smile, 
And a dream that's mine. 
Even if I am 
The only one, 
Who wants to fly.... 
 
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl, 
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world. 
But that's all right, as long as I can have one wish I pray: 
When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say, 
 
She's got her father's eyes. 
Her father's eyes. 
Her father's eyes, ya know. 
Just like my father's eyes.... (Sing, sing, sing!) 
 
(Sing, sing, sing!) 
(Sing, sing, sing!) 
 
Sing your praise to the Lord, 
Come on everybody, 
Stand up and sing... One more 
Hallelujah, 
Give your praise to the Lord, 
I can never tell you, 
Just how much good... That it's 
Gonna do ya, 
Just to sing, sing, sing.... 
 
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! 
You know you really gotta sii-hii-yiing! 
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! (Sing, sing, sing!) 
 
I have decided, 
I'm gonna live like I believer, 
Turn my back on the deceiver. 
I'm gonna live what I believe. 
I have decided, 
Being good is just a fable, 
I just can't 'cause I'm not able. 
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord. 
 
Sing your praise to the Lord, 
Come on everybody, 
Stand up and sing... One more 
Hallelujah, 
Give your praise to the Lord, 
I can never tell you, 
Just how much good... That it's 
Gonna do ya, 
Just to sing, sing, sing.

Even if I found the strength to fly 
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn 
And crashed through the corner of the sky 
If I sailed past the edge of the sea 
Even if I made my bed in Hell 
Still there You would find me 
'Cause nothing is beyond You 
You stand beyond the reach 
Of our vain imaginations 
Our misguided piety 
The heavens stretch to hold You 
And deep cries out to deep 
Singing that nothing is beyond You 
Nothing is beyond You 
Time cannot contain You 
You fill eternity 
Sin can never stain You 
Death has lost its sting 
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me 
Except to say that nothing is beyond You 
Nothing is beyond You 
If I should shrink back from the light 
So I can sink into the dark 
If I take cover and I close my eyes 
Even then You would see my heart 
And You'd cut through all my pain and rage 
The darkness is not dark to You 
And night's as bright as day 
Nothing is beyond You 
You stand beyond the reach 
Of our vain imaginations 
Our misguided piety 
The heavens stretch to hold You 
And deep cries out to deep 
Singing that nothing is beyond You 
Nothing is beyond You

How still we see thee lie 
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
The silent stars go by 
Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years 
Are met in thee tonight 
 
How silently, how silently 
The wondrous gift is given 
So God imparts to human hearts 
The blessings of His heaven 
We hear the Christmas angels 
The great glad tidings tell 
O come to us, abide with us

But in this world of sin 
Where meek souls will receive Him 
Still the dear Christ enters in."

Tighten the harness, brush off the snow

She came into my life 
And made the living fine 
She fills my heart 
 
She fills my heart

With angel songs 
With wild imaginings 
She fills my soul 
With so much love 
That anywhere I go 
I'm never lonely 
With her along who could be lonely 
I reach for her hand 
It's always there 
 
How long does it last 
Can love be measured by the hours in a day 
I have no answers now 
But this much I can say 
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away

Its takes a smile as sweet as butta 
The kind the ladies can't resist 
It takes an orphane with a studda 
Who aint afraid to use his fist 
 
Summa stinks and winters wating 
Welcome to new york 
Boy aint nature fasinating 
When yous gotta walk

Aint it a fine life carrying th banner through it all!"

Everybody was around and I was dancing with you 
We all went down to the party Friday night 
And had a drink there or two 
Oh what a heat 
I feel love and heart beat 
It's electricity 
Majestic sound, round and round and round, got you next to me 
 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a symphony 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a melody, come see 
 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a symphony 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a melody, come see 
 
Time after time everybody came around 
And I was dancing with you 
Don't know your name, 
Making me ashamed 
To feel the way that I do 
The lights went out 
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be 
I won't forget 
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you 
 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a woman in love 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a woman in love so high 
 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a symphony 
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat 
Like a melody, come see 
 
Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
Feel my heartbeat 
 
There was a time when everybody was around and I was dancing with you 
Don't know your name,

We have the answer

By Arlo Guthrie 
Come all you old time cowboys 
And listen to my song 
Please do not grow weary 
I'll not detain you long 
Concerning some wild cowboys 
Who did agree to go 
And spend the summer pleasant 
On the range of the buffalo. 
Well I found myself in Griffin 
In eighteen eighty-three 
When a man by the name of Creagho 
Come a'walkin' up to me 
Sayin ""How do you do young fella 
And how'd you like to go 
And spend the summer pleasant 
On the range of the buffalo"". 
Well me being out of work right then 
To that drover I did say 
""My goin' out on the buffalo range 
Depends upon the pay 
But if you pay good wages, 
Transportation to and fro 
I think I might go with you 
On the range of the Buffalo"". 
Well yes I pay good wages 
And transportation too 
If you'll agree to work for me 
Until the season's through 
But if you do get homesick 
And you try and run away 
You'll starve to death out on the trail 
And you'll also lose your pay 
Well with all the flatterin' talkin' 
He signed up quite a train 
Some ten or twelve in number 
Of able bodied men 
And our trip it was a pleasant one 
Through all New Mexico 
Until we crossed Pease River 
On the range of the buffalo 
It was there our pleasures ended 
And our troubles all begun 
A lightnin' storm come up on us 
And made the cattle run 
We got full of the stickers 
On the cactus that did grow 
And the outlaws waited to pick us off 
In the hills of Mexico 
Well the working season ended 
But the drover would not pay 
He said ""You spent your money boys 
You're all in debt to me"". 
But the cowboys never put much stock 
In a thing like a bankrupt law 
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach 
On the range of the buffalo.

And I need a helping hand

When will you come and rescue me 
It's too late for new beginnings 
In this world I've left behind 
There is nothing left worth keeping 
Not a thing to change my mind

Must we go without a sign 
Caught out on these stormy waters 
How can you treat me so unkind

Oh, don't leave me here abandoned 
In this dark night of the soul

Dream that you're forever 
Gone away from me 
Every toe that I know 
Step away with me

I want to be 
Maybe it's my own foot 
That keeps tripping me 
Trip trap - flip flap 
It must come to wherever from it comes 
Through to me 
I can't walk to where 
My own dreams talk to me 
Every face in this place 
Take your eyes away 
Blink if you think that 
There's another way 
Maybe it's my own eyes 
That don't see the way 
The time is blind 
It may come to pass 
That I will lose my mind

I can't live without the love I left behind

Arlo Guthrie,Gates Of Eden,/a/arlo+guthrie/gates+of+eden_20209380.html,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides 
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides 
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black 
All except beneath the trees of Eden 
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached 
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail 
Through its shadow's metal badge 
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow 
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden 
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains 
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains 
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails 
Heading for the Gates of Eden 
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp 
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf 
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh 
All except inside the Gates of Eden 
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings 
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings 
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings 
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden 
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen 
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream 
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins 
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden 
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot 
While paupers change possessions 
Each one wishing for what the other has got 
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not 
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden 
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine 
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign 
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die 
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden 
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams 
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse 
Into the ditch of what each one means 
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true 
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden "

And the paper they were signing said

And a million copies made 
They all joined hands and bowed their heads 
And grateful pray'rs were prayed 
And the people in the streets below 
Were dancing 'round and 'round 
While swords and guns and uniforms 
Were scattered on the ground

Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again 
Moving through the shadows, almost going blind 
Living like a legend before my time 
If the road don't kill me, baby, I'll see you in the spring 
Making up for lost time between us seems like everything 
If I can make it home alright, you know, I'll treat you fine 
Living like a legend before my time 
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby 
With your man out on the road 
So I'll be coming home tomorrow 
To try to help you carry the load 
I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn 
This kind of living is taking its toll on what I've learned 
You know, it ain't easy leaving you behind 
Living like a legend before my time 
But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay 
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day 
Ooh, I'm going out of my mind 
Living like a legend before my time 
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby 
With your man out on the road 
So I'll be coming home tomorrow 
To try to help you carry the load 
I'll be getting up early 'cause I know, I'm coming home 
I'm so tired of living this legend life alone 
Kick off your shoes, babe, we'll drink a little wine 
Forget about living like a legend before my time 
Forget about living like a legend 
Just forget about the road 
So, look out for me, darling 
On account of your man is coming home "
Arlo Guthrie,Lord Grenville,/a/arlo+guthrie/lord+grenville_20596833.html,"Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn 
It's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern 
We'll be gone before the dawn returns 
Like voices onthe wind. 
 
Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground 
There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town 
None of us are caring where we're bound 
Like voices on the wind. 
 
And come the day you'll hear them saying 
""They're throwing it all away"" 
Nothing more to say 
Just throwing it all away. 
 
Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out 
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about 
None of us are left in any doubt 
We won't be back again. 
 
Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain 
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main 
Tell the ones we left home not to wait 
We won't be back again. 
 
And come the day you'll hear them saying 
""They're throwing it all away"" 
Nothing more to say 
Just throwing it all away. 
 
Our time is just a point along a line 
That runs forever with no end 
I never thought that we would come to find 
Ourselves upon these rocks again. 
 
Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn..."
Arlo Guthrie,Lovesick Blues,/a/arlo+guthrie/lovesick+blues_20247593.html,"By Irving Mills and Cliff Friend 
 
I got a feelin' called the blues, 
Since my baby said good-bye 
Lawd I don't know what l'll do 
All I do is sit and sigh 
That last long day she said goodbye 
Well Lawd, I thought I would cry 
She'd do me, she'd do you, 
She's got that kind of lovin' 
Lawd, I love to hear her 
When she calls me sweet daddy 
 
Such a beautiful dream 
I hate to think it's all over 
I lost my heart it seems 
I've grown so used to you somehow 
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now 
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues 
 
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal 
That's what's the matter with me 
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal 
But she don't care about me 
 
Lawd I tried and tried to keep her satisfied 
But she just wouldn't stay 
So now that she is leavin' 
This is all I say..."

Some times when the sun goes down 
And I'm lost in some other town 
My thoughts may drift away 
To Manzanillo Bay 
And I can see a fisherman 
His day's catch Iying on the sand 
Underneath the palms that sway 
Over Manzanillo Bay 
CHORUS: 
Now I'm missing your silver moon 
Black sands and your blue lagoon 
Some day I would like to be 
Back next to your shining sea 
Drinking rum from a conch shell 
Caught up in your magic spell 
Some day I would like to go 
Back down to Mexico 
I remember your fields of cane 
Your warm breezes and jungle rains 
And watching the children play 
Over Manzanillo Bay 
And out in your market square 
The women sing out to sell their wares 
I've got fresh shrimp today 
From Manzanillo Bay 
CHORUS 
And under the spell of night 
The bay reflecting the harbor light 
You can hear the guitar play 
Over Manzanillo Bay 
And if you're thinking about romance 
And you're willing to take a chance 
Just pick any small cafe 
In Manzanillo Bay 
CHORUS 
Some times when the sun goes down 
And I'm lost in some other town 
My thoughts may drift away 
To Manzanillo Bay

Just me and a friend roamin' around 
Him a magician and I was a clown 
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day 
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way 
 
Crossed over the border to a mystical land 
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand 
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand 
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion 
 
On a roll of the dice we headed out west 
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us 
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand 
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs 
 
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load 
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds 
On target and calm the vision was clear 
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here 
 
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast 
Tryin' to make the most of every situation 
That we witnessed near at hand 
On a drifter's crusade all over the land 
 
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars 
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards 
In a change of your mind in the passing of time 
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line 
 
Just me and a friend roamin' around 
Him a magician I was a clown 
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day 
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way"

Many lessons I have learned 
And I feel like in those hills 
Where I belong 
 
Way down yonder in the Indian nation 
Ridin' my pony on the reservation 
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born 
 
Way down yonder in the Indian nation 
A cowboy's life is my occupation 
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born 
 
But as I sit here today 
Many mile's I am away 
From the place I rode my pony 
Through the draw 
 
Where the oak and black-jack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze 
And I feel back in those hills 
Where I belong 
 
Now as I turn life a page 
To the land of the great Osage 
In those Oklahoma hills 
Where I was born 
 
Where the black oil rolls and flows 
And the snow white cotton grows 
And I feel like in those hills 
Where I belong"

Living now here but for fortune 
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes 
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked 
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams 
Arise sweet destiny, time runs short 
All of your patience has heard their retort 
Hear us now for alone we can't seem 
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams 
Can you hear the words being whispered 
All along the American stream 
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned 
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams 
Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few 
You and your children with nothing to do 
Hear us now for alone we can't seem 
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Can make a skeptic believe

And burns away all the pain

Can make a loser try 
 
The power of love can make a strong man weak 
Can make a bigot meek

The power of love can make a coward brave 
Can make a hero afraid

In the event of my demise 
Be sure to include this statement 
When you are bent on closing my eyes 
Thinking about what my life meant 
Alone on a hill back in '65 
Things looked a lot like changing 
Singing our songs that we harmonized 
Dreaming of worlds rearranging 
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight 
Maybe it's time someone told you 
Just because you say you've seen the light 
Doesn't mean nobody sold you 
I can remember all of your smiles 
During the demonstrations 
Taking on what seemed like the whole world 
Igniting the hearts of our nations 
And together we sang our victory songs 
Though we were worlds apart 
Every thing then has now passed away 
Except for the love in my heart 
Sitting at home on computerized beds 
Tryine to come to conclusions 
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads 
Ignoring the states of illusion 
Drunk in a world of material wealth 
No one can notice you falling 
Fantastic flights once good tor your health 
Now make you deaf to your calling 
And all alone the prophet groans 
With words as yet unseen 
Who'll be awake when the master returns 
Who will be lost in their dreams 
So in the event of my demise 
8e sure to include this statement 
Only the words of love kept alive 
Are worthy of not being wasted

Chorus 
 
This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle. 
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin' 
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a 
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was 
A cliff in the air. 
 
Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles 
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin' 
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar. 
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater 
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's 
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention.. 
 
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff. 
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down 
At the same time. 
 
I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some 
Trip"". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last 
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided 
To write one last farewell song to the world. 
 
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper. 
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin': 
I don't want a pickle 
Just want to ride on my motorsickle 
And I don't want a tickle 
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle 
 
And I don't want to die 
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. "" 
 
I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't 
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast. 
 
But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I 
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away 
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin' 
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song. 
 
I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around 
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned 
Itself off. 
 
I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin' 
Pickles. I said ""Hi, what's happenin'?"" He looked at me in the 
Eye and said ""Nothin'"". 
 
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just

Arlo Guthrie,The Pause Of Mr. Claus,/a/arlo+guthrie/the+pause+of+mr+claus_20292956.html,"This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American 
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys 
In the FBI. 
 
Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first 
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old. 
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the 
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just 
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your 
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a 
Meaningful shape in today's complex society. 
 
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I 
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have 
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job. 
Follow me around. 
 
I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I 
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They 
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you 
Know. 
 
I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether 
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't 
Come back and they're stayin' with the car. 
 
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12 
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that 
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane 
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the 
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats 
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that 
You have to go. 
 
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't 
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna 
Do? 
 
Well, it's a drag for him. But that"
Arlo Guthrie,The Streets Of Laredo,/a/arlo+guthrie/streets+of+laredo_20328407.html,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo 
As I walked out in Laredo one day 
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen 
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay 
 
""""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy"""" 
These words he did say as I proudly stepped by 
""""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story 
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die 
 
""""'Twas once in the saddle I used to go ridin' 
Once in the saddle I used to go gay 
First lead to drinkin', and then to card-playing 
I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today 
 
""""Let six jolly cowboys come carry my coffin 
Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall 
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin 
Throw roses to deaden the clods as they fall 
 
""""Oh, beat the drum slowly, and play the fife lowly 
And play the dead march as you carry me along 
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me 
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong"""" 
 
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly 
And bitterly wept as we carried him along 
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome 
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong"

This land is your land, this land is my land 
From California, to the New York Island 
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters 
This land was made for you and me 
 
As I was walking a ribbon of highway 
I saw above me an endless skyway 
I saw below me a golden valley 
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps 
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts 
And all around me a voice was sounding 
This land was made for you and me

The sun comes shining as I was strolling 
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling 
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting 
This land was made for you and me 
 
Chorus 
 
As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there 
And that sign said - no tress passin' 
But on the other side.... It didn't say nothin! 
Now that side was made for you and me! 
 
Chorus 
 
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple 
Near the relief office - I see my people 
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin' 
If this land's still made for you and me.

Arlo Guthrie,Utah Carroll,/a/arlo+guthrie/utah+carroll_20314424.html,"Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie 
So you ask me my kind friend 
Why I am sad and still 
And why my brow is darkened 
Like the clouds upon the hill 
Rein in your ponies closer 
And I'll tell you all a tale 
Of Utah Carroll, partner 
And his last ride on the trail 
In a grave without a headstone 
Without a date or name 
My partner lies there silent 
In the land from which I came 
Long ago we rode together 
We'd ridden side by side 
I loved him like a brother 
And I wept when Utah died 
While riding up one morning 
And our work was almost done 
The cattle quickly started 
On a wild and maddening run 
The boss's little daughter 
Who was riding on that side 
Rushed in to stop the stampede 
It was there my partner died 
Lenore upon her pony 
Tried to turn the cattle right 
But her blanket slipped beneath her 
And she caught and held on tight 
When we all saw that red blanket 
Each cowboy held his breath 
For should her pony fail her 
None could save the girl from death 
When the cattle saw the blanket 
Almost dragging on the ground 
They were maddened in a moment 
And they charged with deafening sound 
The girl soon saw her danger 
And she turned her pony's face 
And bending in her saddle 
Tried the blanket to replace 
Just then she lost her balance 
In the front of that wild tide 
Carroll's voice controlled the round up 
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried 
And then close up beside her 
Came Utah riding fast 
But little did the poor boy know 
The ride would be his last 
Full often from the saddle 
He had caught the trailing rope 
To pick her up at full speed 
Was now his only hope 
He swung low from his saddle 
To take her to his arm 
We thought that he'd succeeded 
That the girl was safe from harm 
But such a strain upon his saddle 
Had ne'er been put before 
And the cinches gave beneath him 
And he fell beside Lenore 
When the girl fell from her saddle 
She had dragged the blanket down 
It lay there close beside them 
Where they lay upon the ground 
Utah took the blanket 
And to Lenore he said 
""Lie still"" and quickly running 
Waved the red thing o'er his head 
He turned the maddened cattle 
From Lenore, his little friend 
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him 
He turned to met his end 
And as the herd came on him 
His weapon quickly drew 
He was bound to die defended 
As all brave cowboys do 
The weapon flashed like lightning 
And it sounded loud and clear 
As the cattle rushed and killed him 
He dropped the leading steer 
When I broke through that wide circle 
To where poor Utah lay 
With a thousand wounds and bruises 
His life blood ebbed away 
I knelt down close beside him 
And I knew that all was o'er 
As I heard him faintly whisper 
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore"" 
Next morning at the churchyard 
I heard the preacher say 
""Don't think our kind friend Utah 
Was lost on that great day 
He was a much-loved cowboy 
And not afraid to die 
And we'll meet him at the round up 
On the plains beyond the sky"" 
So you ask me my kind friend 
Why I am sad and still 
And why my brow is darkened 
Like the clouds upon the hill 
Rein in your ponies closer 
And I'll tell you all a tale 
Of Utah Carroll, partner 
And his last ride on the trail

Victor Jara of Chile 
Lived like a shooting star 
He fought for the people of Chile 
With his songs and his guitar 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
Victor Jara was a peasant 
He worked from a few years old 
He sat upon his father's plow 
And watched the earth unfold 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
Now when the neighbors had a wedding 
Or one of their children died 
His mother sang all night for them 
With Victor by her side 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
He grew up to be a fighter 
Against the people's wrongs 
He listened to their grief and joy 
And turned them into songs 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
He sang about the copper miners 
And those who worked the land 
He sang about the factory workers 
And they knew he was their man 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
He campaigned for Allende 
Working night and day 
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand 
You know the future begins today"" 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
Then the generals seized Chile 
They arrested Victor then 
They caged him in a stadium 
With five-thousand frightened men 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
Victor stood in the stadium 
His voice was brave and strong 
And he sang for his fellow prisoners 
Till the guards cut short his song 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
They broke the bones in both his hands 
They beat him on the head 
They tore him with electric shocks 
And then they shot him dead 
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong 
Repeat first verse

And back home, they don't know too much 
There's just no way to tell 
I guess you had to be there 
For to know that war was hell 
And there won't be any victory parades 
For those that's coming back 
They'll fly them in at midnight 
And unload the body sacks 
And the living will be walking down 
A long and lonely road 
Because nobody seems to care these days 
When a soldier makes it home 
They'll say it wasn't easy 
Just another job, well done 
As the government in Kabul falls 
To the sounds of rebel guns 
And the faces of the comrades 
Being blown out of the sky 
Leaves you bitter with the feeling 
That they didn't have to die 
And there won't be any victory parades

And there wasn't any big parades

And unloaded all the sacks 
And the living were left walking down 
A long and lonely road 
Because nobody seemed to care back then 
When a soldier made it home 
The night is coming quickly 
And the stars are on their way 
As I stare into the evening 
Looking for the words to say 
That I saw the lonely soldier 
Just a boy that's far from home 
And I saw that I was just like him 
While upon this earth I roam 
And there may not be any big parades 
If I ever make it back 
As I come home under cover 
Through a world that can't keep track 
Of the heroes who have fallen 
Let alone the ones who won't 
Which is why nobody seems to care 
When a soldier makes it home "

A team of lonely fishermen sold me to a park,

I'm swimming in a pool, 
I'm a shark, I'm a shark, 
I don't have to fight for food, 
I get three meals a day, and some extra on the weekend 
And I'm the only shark I know who has a dental plan. 
Who has a dental plan. 
 
(He's a shark, he's a shark,) 
And I'm a big attraction. 
(He's a shark, he's a shark,) 
They love to watch me jump, 
I've been the star for years and I've never been for sale, 
At least until the owners think they need a killer whale. 
 
Billy, the themepark shark, 
Jumping out football nets suspended overhead, 
Billy, the themepark shark, 
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed. 
 
I'm a shark, I'm a shark, 
But I'm not in my natural habitat, 
He's fat and old and lazy, 
But I'm happy you're here. 
I really hope these activists don't free Billy, 
'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead. 
 
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy, 
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.

Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night 
This killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight 
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime 
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radish can't scream 
 
[Chorus] 
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream) 
Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed) 
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories) 
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad) 
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime) 
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go) 
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell) 
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade) 
 
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue 
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two 
I'm a political prisoner, trapped in a windowless cage 
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage 
I told the judge when he sentenced me, ""This is my finest hour, 
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower"" 
 
[Chorus] 
How low as people do we dare to stoop, 
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup? 
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes 
Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato! 
Oh spare the spud! Eat a cow instead! 
 
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream) 
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir-fry are sealed) 
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob) 
How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field) 
Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide) 
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)

When all I want is money to buy beer

So in the Christmas play I was the ox 
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus

My love is consumating, while I'm asphyxiating 
Over her 
 
When I wake up, I'm on the floor 
Faint, dizzy and alone 
My stomach hurts, I think my ribs are cracked 
Not sure if I'm in a dream 
I turn my head, and there you are 
I call out and my breathing stops 
It's her again, crushing my esophagus 
 
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver 
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat 
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her 
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation 
Mouth to mouth 
 
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek 
Helps me back on my stool 
She's a waitress here, but in the night 
She's a student at nursing school 
She comes again with a smile and the bill 
I pick it up and choke again 
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure 
 
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver 
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat 
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her 
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance 
For my bill 
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy 
And an airbag"

Now it barks all the night and all of the day 
Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn 
I didn't get to sleep last night till very late 
The stupid dog barked and grrrr'd 
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus 
But I slipped on a turd 
I was certain it wasn't one of mine 
That that dog had crossed over the line 
I wanted to exterminate it and all it's kind 
From my lovely little suburb 
I'm gonna kill the dog next door 
Ain't gonna bark anymore 
'Cause this is Judgment Day 
And the little runt has got to pay 
No more turds on my lawn 
That stupid mutt will soon be gone 
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog 
I see the little monster in my garden 
So I grab an axe and off I go 
And I try my best to get it 
All I do is sever my big toe 
My neighbour comes outside to call me 
He says his dog and me should just be friends 
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands 
Then it starts to bite 
So I strangle it with all my might 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Now the stupid mutt's in doggy heaven 
I strangled it to death and now I'm free 
But my trouble ain't quite over 
My neighbour called the cops on me 
I end up at the police station 
Where I am told that I must pay 
A 300 dollar fine 
Wow, what a good value 
I think I'll kill my neighbour too! 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
I'm gonna kill the guy next door (kill the guy next door) 
Won't call the cops anymore

With tangled hair upon my head 
In every way I really was a kid 
It happened without warning 
When I woke up in the morning 
I can't tell you just what happened but it did 
 
I grew six inches in one day 
It's painful when it goes that way 
And now my skinny body's really achin' 
And my skin just exploded 
With an inch of oil it's loaded 
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon 
 
My voice is changing 
Out of thin air 
And body parts that once were smooth 
Are growing bits of hair 
My voice is changing 
What does it mean? 
I guess I'll be a real man 
Before I turn 13 
 
I buy two pairs of jeans a week 
I'm such a tall and awkward geek 
I fall down when I try to play a grounder 
At dinner every night I eat 
A giant heaping plate of meat 
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders 
 
And weird emotions come alive 
My hormones are in overdrive 
I've turned into a girl-watching creature 
And all my friends their marks are shot 
But they don't care because they're hot 
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher 
 
My voice is changing 
I hate to hear it crack 
I pray to God I won't inherit 
Dad's hairy back 
My voice is changing 
When will it end? 
And when will mom stop kissing me 
In front of all my friends? 
 
Pretty soon I bet I'll 
Be right into heavy metal 
But my parents say at least it isn't rap 
I'll start wearing stupid clothes 
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose 
And tell my parents all they like is crap 
 
The first girl that I ever kiss 
Will be the one and who could miss 
Our love forever written in the stars? 
But I don't think our love will last 
Unless the four years go by fast 
Till I can use the backseat of the car 
 
My voice is changing 
Out of thin air 
And body parts that once were smooth 
Are growing bits of hair 
My voice is changing 
What does it mean? 
I guess I'll be a real man 
Before I turn 13 
 
My voice is changing 
I hate to hear it crack 
I pray to God I won't inherit

The only thing that's holding this 
Explosion of Caucasian is 
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread 
I try to sink it in the sand 
And entomb it in a castle but 
It always manages to break free 
The fat man in a Speedo 
I'm having nightmares 
I'm scared to open my eyes 
I try to free myself 
By going to the buffet 
But there he is 
He even eats in his Speedo 
I take up a collection at the bar the next day 
And everybody gives to the cause 
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale 
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk 
We have a celebration 
In one of his indentations 
And throw a bowl of jello in the air 
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear 
But in comes a plane from Germany 
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!"

There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes
and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was
built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the
railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength
of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm
gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man
as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick. 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
Who never really gave a damn 
Only thing he worked on was his tan 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes 
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night 
Or if his bones weren't feeling right 
Or if it looked like it was going to rain 
He had a tendency of being late for work 
And everyone around thought he was a jerk 
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt 
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
Who never really gave a damn 
Only thing he worked on was his tan 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike! 
Mike: What, what is it? 
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work. 
Mike: Awww, already? 
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes? 
Mike: No. 
Mike's dad: Oh. 
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws 
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft 
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough 
Then go home and take a little nap 
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son 
He just hung around and bothered everyone 
Never drove a spike, not a single one 
Though now and then he'd give a tap 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
Who never really gave a damn 
Only thing he worked on was his tan 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man 
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE! 
Mike: What? What is it? 
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails
faster than any man alive. 
Mike: Sounds like a good idea. 
Mike's dad: No! No! No! 
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster. 
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs.
You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong! 
Mike: Okay. 
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!) 
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!) 
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!) 
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died 
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man

Thinking of the job that's to be done 
My life is hard but I don't mind 
Men like me, that's how the west was won 
I stand the pain and the suffering 
For on the trail I am the king 
On doors I knock and on bells I ring 
Always sure that I will get the sale 
 
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman 
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride 
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally 
And on the dotted line I make them sign 
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey! 
 
The door swings wide and I sense my prey 
Ready to fall victim to my pitch 
I tell him all about the plan 
With all of its inherent benefits 
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks 
Lose both of them and get twice as much 
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck 
You'll just be raking in the cash 
 
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman 
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride 
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally 
And on the dotted line I make them sign 
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey! 
 
The sucker signs, the deed is done 
It's time for me to get back on the road 
A lonely man out on the land 
Where the wind can blow so cold 
I ride into the setting sun 
With the knowledge of a job well done 
But I can't rest until everyone 
Has become properly insured 
 
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman 
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride 
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally 
And on the dotted line I make them sign 
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!

Arrogant Worms,The Happy Happy Birthday Song,/a/arrogant+worms/the+happy+happy+birthday+song_20009329.html,"Once a year we celebrate 
With stupid hats and plastic plates 
The fact that you were able to make 
Another trip around the sun 
 
And the whole clan gathers round 
And gifts and laughter do abound 
And we let out a joyful sound 
And sing that stupid song 
 
Happy birthday! 
Now you're one year older! 
Happy birthday! 
Your life still isn't over! 
Happy birthday! 
You did not accomplish much 
But you didn't die this year 
I guess that's good enough 
 
So let's drink to your fading health 
And hope you don't remind yourself 
The chance of finding fame and wealth 
Decrease with every year 
 
Does it feel like you're doing laps 
And eating food and taking naps 
And hoping that someday perhaps 
Your life will hold some cheer 
 
Happy birthday! 
What have you done that matters? 
Happy birthday! 
You're starting to get fatter 
Happy birthday! 
It's downhill from now on 
Try not to remind yourself 
Your best years are all gone 
 
If cryogenics were all free 
Then you could live like Walt Disney 
And live for all eternity 
Inside a block of ice 
 
But instead your time is set 
This is the only life you get 
And though it hasn't ended yet 
Sometimes you wish it might 
 
Happy birthday! 
You wish you had more money 
Happy birthday! 
Your life's so sad it's funny 
Happy birthday! 
How much more can you take? 
But your friends are hungry 
So just cut the stupid cake 
 
Happy birthday!

I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory 
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys 
If his theory is accurate and who am I to say? 
Does the opposite work going the other way? 
If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey 
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure 
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George 
I would sit around all day just eating bananas 
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas 
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies 
Monkey see, monkey do 
That would be my excuse 
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see 
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice 
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice 
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it 
I'd be more than happy to prove it 
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not 
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson 
I could provide some simian distraction 
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness 
I wanna be a monkey yes I do 
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo 
I wanna be a monkey 
I'd be agape if I was an ape 
What a thrilla to be a gorilla 
It would rock to be a macaque

profession 
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliament's in
session 
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every
parade 
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending my career in

I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos

I used to think that a mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble, strong and
thrifty 
But even though we don't break ranks, we get no thanks, they took us off the
fifty (dollar bill) 
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls, it's
such a pain 
Like someone's plotting the assassination of the Minister if Sports and
Recreation, oh that's insane 
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dudley Do-
Right's such a jerk (Damn you, Snidely)

Arrogant Worms,The War Of 1812,/a/arrogant+worms/the+war+of+1812_20518504.html,"Come back proud canadian's, 
To before you had TV. 
No hockey night in canada, 
There was no CBC. 
 
In 1812 madison was mad, 
He was the president you know. 
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go. 
He thought he'd invade canada, 
He thought that he was tough. 
Instead we went to washington, 
And burned down all his stuff. 
 
And the white house burned, burned, burned. 
And we're the ones that did it, 
It burned, burned, burned. 
While the president ran and cried, 
It burned, burned, burned. 
And things were very historical, 
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa 
In the war of 1812. 
 
Those hilbilies from kentucky, 
Dressed in green and red. 
Left home to fight in canada, 
But they returned home dead. 
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam. 
And also the alomo and the bay of ham. 
The looser was america, 
The winner was ourselfs. 
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812. 
 
And the white house burned, burned, burned. 
And we're the ones that did it, 
It burned, burned, burned. 
While the president ran and cried, 
It burned, burned, burned. 
And things were very historical, 
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa 
In the war of 1812. 
 
In 1812 we were just sitting around, 
Minding our own business, 
Putting crops into the ground. 
We heard the soilders coming, 
And we didn't like that sound. 
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground. 
 
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming, 
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago. 
We fired once more and the yankies started running, 
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico. 
They ran through the snow, 
And they ran through the forest, 
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go, 
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture, 
Back to america, and gulf and mexico. 
 
So if you go to washington, 
It's building clean and nice, 
Bring a pack of matches, 
And we'll burn the white house twice. 
 
And the white house burned, burned, burned, 
But the americans wont admit it. 
It burned, burned, burned... 
It burned and burned and burned 
It burned, burned, burned 
I bet that made them mad. 
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa 
In the war of 1812."

Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky

Greeting all the viewers with a ""Hi-hi-hip-hello!"" 
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show 
 
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock 
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog 
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry 
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy 
 
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman 
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland 
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal 
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210 
 
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke

He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys

Open it up to find a note, 
Heres what he wrote: 
'Girl, I know you want me, 
If you do, come and get me, 
Be at the park, by sundown, 
When nobody else is around, 
Be there if you want me. ' 
Signed no name, 
By the look in my eyes, 
I could tell it was him, 
He stared at me, with a grin,

Going through my pages 
Through the good and the bad times 
Why are you, sayin' to me, 
This ain't your everyday life girl,

Fall asleep all alone 
Hear your voice in the dark 
Lose myself in your eyes 
Choke my voice Say goodnight 
As the world falls apart 
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go 
I need some more time to fix this 
 
Here's a letter for you 
But the words get confused 
And the conversation dies 
Apologize for the past 
Talk some shit take it back 
Are we cursed to this life 
 
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go 
I need some more time to fix this problem 
I need some more time to fix this problem 
I need some more time to fix this 
 
I'm talking to the ceiling 
My life just lost all meaning 
Do one thing for me tonight 
I'm dying in this silence 
 
The last star left in heaven 
Is falling down to earth and 
Do you still feel the same way 
Do you still feel the same way 
 
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go 
I need some more time to fix this problem 
I need some more time to fix this problem 
I need some more time to fix this"

Holding on inside 
Nobody to hear me scream 
Nobody to hear me cry 
Too close to no nobody 
Too far to hold onto life 
There's nowhere to run 
And onwhere to hide 
 
Hold onto yourself 
Hold onto the life that u live 
Hold onto me 
And neva let go 
Don't be afraid 
To face the dangers each day 
Hold onto me 
And neva let go 
 
Too heavy to fly away 
Too light to try to die 
Too false to live no truth 
Too trughful to deny 
Too weak to live 
Too strong to hold back now 
Too many answers 
To ask the qusetion how

Don't deny that u live 
Don't deny that u breathe 
Just hold onto me 
Don't lie 'cos ur real 
Don't lie u can deal with this 
Hold onto me

I get lost and I can't sleep

I can't descibe the joy they bring 
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me 
 
My boifriend is by my side 
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice 
Their whiny voices get irritating 
It's Christmas time again 
 
So I stand with a dead smile on my face 
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste 
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers 
 
And then I guess I must have snapped 
Because I grabbed the baseball bat 
And made them all run for shelter 
 
It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand 
All year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer 
You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't wanna get beat down 
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone 
 
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve 
Cause the cops came and arrested me 
They had an unfair advantage 
And even though the jail didn't have a tree 
Christmas came a night early 
Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package 
 
It's Christmas time again 
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand 
All year 
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer 
You people scare me 
Please stay away from my home 
If you don't wanna get beat down 
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

After you came and went 
How can you say you meant anything different 
To anyone standing alone on the street 
With a cigarette on the first night we met 
 
Look to the past and remember your smile 
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile 
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep 
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

I ain't got a doubt 
I know this is the one 
And if you feel 
Like nothing will change 
Stay for real 
Reality's not out of your range

You can burn 
Or just go

It tells a million lies 
But deep inside, I know why 
You're talking to him 
 
I know what you're all about 
I really hope he figures it out

She's one of those girls 
They're nothing but trouble 
Just one look and now you're seeing double 
Before you know it she'll be gone 
Off to the next one 
She's so good that you won't see it comin' 
She'll take you for a ride, and you'll be left with nothing 
You'll be broke, and she'll be gone 
Off to the next one 
 
Oh, oh, oh 
Off to the next one 
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh 
 
She's gonna be the end of you 
At least that's what they say 
It's been a while 
You're in denial 
And now it's too late 
The way she looks makes you hide 
All the warning signs 
'Cause her blond hair, her blue eyes 
Makes you wanna die 
 
I know what she's all about 
I really hope you figure it out

You know it's a game, you know it's a game 
She keeps playing around with your head 
Playing around with your head 
She's so insane, so insane 
She's the one to blame, she's the one to blame

For us to say goodbye 
What a big surprise 
 
But I'm not lost 
I'm not gone 
I haven't forgot

I can feel it falling down 
And I'm not coming back around 
These feelings I can't take no more

It's getting harder to pretend 
And I'm not coming back around again 
 
Remember when 
 
I remember when it was together till the end 
Now I'm alone again 
Where do I begin? 
I cried a little bit 
You died a little bit 
Please say there's no regrets 
And say you won't forget 
But I'm not lost 
And I'm not gone 
I haven't forgot

Feeding the baby she's all alone 
She turns on t.v

Skater boy rockin' up MTV 
She calls up her friends 
They already know 
 
And they've all got 
Tickets to see his show 
She tags along 
Stands in the crowd 
Looks up at the man that she turned down

See the man that boy could be 
There is more that meets the eye 
I see the soul that is inside 
 
He's just a boy 
And I'm just a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious 
We are in love 
Haven't you heard 
How we rock each others world

You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never 
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me 
We're not the same

Avril Lavigne,The Hockey Song,/a/avril+lavigne/the+hockey+song_20517877.html,"Hello out there, were on the air 
It's hockey night tonight! 
Tension grows, 
As the whistle blows, 
And the puck goes down the ice. 
The goalie jumps, 
And the players bump, 
And the fans all go insane. 
Someone roars: 
""Bobby Scores!"" 
At the good old hockey game! 
 
[Chorus:] 
Oh! 
The good old hockey game! 
It's the best game you can name! 
And the best game you can name, 
Is the good old hockey game! 
 
Second Period. 
Players dash, 
With skates a-flash, 
The home team trails behind. 
But they grab the puck, 
And go bursting up, 
And they're down across the line. 
They storm the crease, 
Like bumblebees, 
They travel like a burning flame. 
See them slide the puck inside, 
It's a one one hockey game! 
 
[Chorus:] 
Oh! 
The good old hockey game! 
It's the best game you can name! 
And the best game you can name, 
Is the good old hockey game! 
 
Third Period. 
Last game in the play-offs too. 
Oh take me where, the hockey players, 
Face off down the rink, 
And the Stanley Cup, 
Is all filled up, 
For the champs who win the drink! 
Now the final flick, 
Of a hockey stick, 
And a one gigantic scream: 
""THE PUCK IS IN! THE HOME TEAM WINS!"" 
At the good old hockey game 
 
(chorus- repeat 3 times) 
Oh! 
The good old hockey game! 
It's the best game you can name! 
And the best game you can name, 
Is the good old hockey game!"

But I'm there when you're not over his friend 
I listen when you come to me 
But 'cause of who he is you don't have the time to see 
 
I really feel the way you feel 
Just 'cause it's him don't mean it's not real 
Your always sayin' your love's true 
I listen but I can't say the same for you

What I offer's unreturned 
You don't have time to see me burn 
You've so far failed to see 
How much you're affecting me

When you think of him 
I'm thinkin' of the other guy 
I'm in love to 
He's constantly on my mind 
If you weren't shared by blood 
Then would you have the time 
I don't get to choose 
Who I dream of at night 
You tell me how you feel 
I feel the same way with the other guy 
So bad it's not real 
You can't make me cover it up, you know I really try 
You can see by my skin 
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes 
I'm nervous and I know it's a sin 
But seein' him drives me wild inside 
 
[Verse 3:] 
If it was another 
Maybe not your brother 
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild? 
But then lookin' back 
You've always turned your back 
Would it be ok to listen to my smile? 
 
[Verse 4] 
Your convinced 
He's so unperfect 
But I'm convinced 
That it's worth it 
 
I listen to you goin on and on 
Bout how you and that boy got it on 
You don't have time to listen to me 
I'm in love but you can't see 
I don't have opinions you just talk 
But with me you tell me I'm stupid to feel what I feel 
I can't run away you only let me walk

I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there 
 
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing 
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me 
She's the one, she'll always be there 
She took my hand and I made it I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show 
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know 
She's so cool, better sneak me through her window 
Everything's better when she's around 
I Can't wait until her parents go out of town 
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show 
 
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas 
I remember the look her mother gave us 
17 without a purpose or direction 
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation

Black and white picture of her on my wall 
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting 
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance 
Because she kept me waiting

It's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy

Pulling the puzzles apart 
Questions of science, science and progress 
Do not speak as loud as my heart 
 
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me 
Oh and I rush to the start 
Running in circles, chasing our tails 
Coming back as we are

Would it melt away?

Counting every dime 
Shutting out the ones I loved

By loneliness and despair 
And deep inside I thought I heard 
""Lean on me, I'm here""

Shining down on me 
I pulled the burden from off my back 
And tossed it into the wind 
And stretched my arms toward the sky 
And let my life begin 
 
And like a tree, I have measured up 
Best when I've been cut down 
And like a tree, I can touch the sky 
With my feet on the ground

I got my heart set 
My feet wet 
But he don't even know it yet 
No one needs to know 
Right now. 
 
I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow 
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now 
 
I want bells to ring 
The choir to sing 
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing 
But no one needs to know 
Right now. 
 
I'll tell him, someday, someway, someway 
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now. 
 
Gonna have a little girl 
A little boy 
A little engy we call Leroy 
But no one needs to know 
Right now.

And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right

Never trusted anyone in the first place,

Let me tell you what I see through my eyes 
Apathy is all around and on the rise 
We channel so much energy through our greed 
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need 
Lemme tell you 
 
Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 
 
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools 
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do 
We compromise our liberties for security 
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see 
Lemme tell you 
 
Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you 
Living is more than profits accrued 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together 
 
Don't throw in the towel 
Let's overcome the test for now 
Together (together) we last, divided we fall 
Love will conquer all 
 
Money can't buy lives 
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you) 
Living is more than profits accrued 
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now) 
We need to love and be loved 
And brought in the things we are thankful of 
Remember your brothers and sisters 
Because we are all in this together

The sun, the stars, the moon 
As long as your love's there to lead me 
I won't lose my way believe me 
Even through the darkest night you know

For sentimental fools

Couldn't live my life without you in it 
And now I want the whole world 
To know

Backstreet Boys,Cinderella,/b/backstreet+boys/cinderella_20595487.html,"As I was walking down a 
Path in the woods one day I 
Came across a vision that caught my eye 
 
There was a lady standing 
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper 
What you wish for you can have 
 
Then the vision went away 
I thought that I had lost her 
The girl I had been waiting for 
I can't believe I just saw her 
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine 
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more 
Whoahhhh

Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and 
You're the one I'll always cherish

Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and 
You're the one I'll love forever 
I ya ya ya ya ya 
 
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and 
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain 
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night 
You know if I could have all that 
That's all I wish for in my life 
 
Why did she have to go 
What do I say to find her 
This girl is the only one 
I cannot deny her 
She's making love to my mind 
And I can't forget this feeling 
It's her voice that's calling 
It's her voice I need 
Whoahhh

Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers 
I give you what you need

I want to feel your body next to mine 
And before this night is over 
You will know what I need

Hold me and don't you let go

Once there was a time love was just a myth 
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist 
Til the day you came into my life 
You forced me to think twice 
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich 
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this 
That's why until this day I'm still your man 
Cause you made me understand that 
 
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair 
The two of us but no one there 
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs 
To hold you in my arms after we make love 
Love is waking up to see your face 
Or kissing in the morning rain 
Love is 
The only thing that keeps me sane 
At the end of the day is that I've got you 
 
You're my secret place where I can be myself 
You connect with me like nobody else 
Even though our circumstances changed 
Our love still remains 
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly 
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely 
So no matter what tomorrow brings 
We got the simple things cause (noooo)

Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise

Just roll with it 
It's gonna be alright 
Just roll with it 
Don't put yourself down 
Just roll with it 
 
If you just can't find someone to trust 
When you give your heart but you don't get much 
Don't you worry the time is gonna come

So much to learn 
So learn it well 
The world's a stage 
So act the fool

Backstreet Boys,Shout,/b/backstreet+boys/shout_20595461.html,"Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces, 
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons, 
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is, 
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things, 
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it, 
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it 
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it, 
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me. 
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be, 
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty, 
There has to be some type of change for this day and age, 
We gotta rearrange and flip the page, 
Living encaged like animals and cannibals, 
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five, 
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive 
Peace of mind's so hard to find. 
 
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout 
What's this madness all about 
All this makes me wanna shout 
You know it makes me wanna shout, 
Throw my hands up and shout 
What's this madness all about 
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now 
 
Problems, complications and accusations 
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces 
A war is taking place. 
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace 
Is increasing the height of your spirituality. 
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions 
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living. 
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning, 
But will we live to see the dawn. 
 
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be 
Is a living hell torturing our minds. 
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light, 
And the love in our hearts will shine. 
 
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other 
Whatever happened to protecting each other 
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure, 
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever. 
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted, 
Family values are contradicted. 
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough. 
 
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout 
What's this madness all about 
All this makes me wanna shout 
You know it makes me wanna shout, 
Throw my hands up and shout 
What's this madness all about 
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now"

Taste of freedom before getting 
Married next week. 
 
Erika (speaking)- 
At least, you're not an 
Indentured servant. 
 
Anneliese (speaking)- 
Indentured servant? 
 
Erika- 
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot 
Madame Carp will make me pay, 
And I have to fetch the eggs myself 
And the barn's a mile away. 
It's cold and wet 
But still I get an omelette on my plate, 
But in my head I'm back in bed 
Snuggled up and sleeping late. 
 
Anneliese (speaking)- 
Really? 
 
Erika (speaking)- 
Really. But it's all right. 
I mean, I'm used to it. 
And you? 
 
Anneliese (speaking)- 
Well... 
 
Erika (speaking)- 
Well? 
Anneliese- 
If I want some eggs I ring the bell 
And the maid comes running in, 
And she serves them on a silver tray 
And she brings a cookie tin. 
And while I eat, she rubs my feet 
And strolling minstrels play, 
But I'd rather be in my library 
Reading science books all day.

But now I've met you and I know, 
It's plain as day 
Sure as the sky is blue

No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary. 
Uh, I mean, Dress Emporium.

I love Madame Carp's dresses!

I made the one you're wearing.

You made this? The design looks so complicated! 
 
Erika (speaking)- 
Oh, it isn't really. 
(sings) 
First I choose a fabric from the rack 
And I pin the pattern down, 
And I stitch it in the front and back 
And it turns into a gown! 
Anneliese- 
I wear my gown 
Without my crown 
And dance around my room 
Both- 
And imagine life without the strife 
Of an unfamiliar groom. 
 
Anneliese (speaking)- 
But I'd never let my mother know. 
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.

I completely understand.

A thousand dolls 
A child is born 
Her chin is like mine 
But her eyes are yours 
How perfectly formed are her fingers 
So far reach, so much to know 
What words will be formed by her fingers 
We'll hold her close 
Then let her go 
How sweet to find 
A part of ourselves 
We knew nothing of 
A child is born 
A child that is born of our love"

Waiting there for me underneath the tree

Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsel silver glow

Telling you that less is more 
You cannot disguise whatever you do

People just surviving, we live a double life 
 
You'd be safe and warm at home

And we become invisible

Break away the chains that bind 
It's not enough to be satisfied 
It's knowing how it all begins 
Or knowing where the heart belongs 
 
And we all make mistakes 
It's your heart and my heart 
And no one can take part 
And our love, love above the law 
 
So you decide we go insane 
I know what you came here for 
Whether you're mine, I'll never be sure 
We'll ever be above the law 
 
On this dark and stormy night 
Where these walls may hide us 
(The walls may hide us) 
You sigh and let me in 
 
You let me hold you in these arms of mine 
(One flame inside) 
Tomorrow is eternity

And we may get to kiss and say no more about it 
(No tears to cry) 
 
And if my eyes are watching you 
Baby, life could be so beautiful

And everything is possible 
(Everything is possible) 
And we become invisible

It's your heart and my heart 
And no one can take part 
I'll always be with you 
It's what I'm living for

Is outside your window 
And our love is one love

Barbra Streisand,Adelaide's Lament,/b/barbra+streisand/adelaides+lament_20012613.html,"[From ""Guys And Dolls""] 
 
The average unmarried female 
Basic'lly insecure 
Due to some long frustration 
May react 
With psychosomatic symptoms 
Difficult to endure 
Affecting the upper respiratory tract 
In other words, 
Just from waiting around 
For that little band of gold 
A person can develop a cold 
You can spray her wherever you figure 
The streptococci lurk 
You can give her a shot 
For whatever she's got 
But it just won't work 
If she's tired of getting the fish-eye 
From the hotel clerk 
A person 
Can develop a cold 
The female remaining single 
Just in the legal sense 
Shows a neurotic tendency 
See note: 
Note: Chronic organic syndromes 
Toxic and hypertense 
Involving the eye, 
The ear and the nose and throat 
In other words, 
Just from worrying 
Whether the wedding is on or off, 
A person 
Can develop a cough 
You can feed her all day 
With the Vitamin A 
And the Bromo Fizz 
But the medicine never 
Gets anywhere near 
Where the trouble is 
If she's getting a kind 
Of name for herself 
And the name ain't ""his"" 
A person 
Can develop a cough 
And further more 
Just from stalling 
And stalling and stalling 
The wedding trip 
A person 
Can develop La grippe 
When they get on a train 
For Niag'ra 
And she can hear church bells chime 
The compartment is air conditioned 
And the mood sublime 
Then they get off at Saratoga 
For the fourteenth time 
A person 
Can develop La grippe 
La grippe, La post nasal drip 
With the wheezes 
And the sneezes 
And a sinus that's really a pip! 
For a lack of community property 
And a feeling she's getting too old 
A person 
Can develop 
A bad, bad cold!"
Barbra Streisand,After The Rain,/b/barbra+streisand/after+the+rain_20013258.html,"After we love, we bathe in a glow 
Remembering what happened a moment ago 
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh 
While it's resting on pillows of sky 
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm 
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm 
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through 
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you 
 
After the rain, the birds want to fly 
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry 
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see 
Are their loving reflections of me 
After a while, you touch me and then 
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again 
 
And then lost in a kiss, 
I could stay for hours like this 
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain 
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain"

When sweet childhood flies

And the breeze blue the sand from my eyes

Diamonds would weigh me down 
Pompoms and plums are pretty 
If you're a circus clown 
Funny how black mascara 
Streaks when the tears begin 
Nail polish, rouge and powder 
Can't paint the sparkle in 
Once I was slaved to a sneeze 
Now sneezing is just a disease 
A rose is a rose 
And a nose just a nose

Real love's a leaving thing

I want the things I sing

To give your heart a song to sing 
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love! 
And in July a lemonade 
To cool you in some leafy glade 
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love! 
 
My breaking heart and i agree 
That you and i could never ever be 
So with my best, my very best, i set you free! 
I wish you shelter from the storm 
A cozy fire to keep you warm 
But most of all, but most of all 
 
When snowflakes fall, i wish you wealth 
I wish you health, i wish you love!"
Barbra Streisand,Closer,/b/barbra+streisand/closer_20718678.html,"As close as the sea is to the seashore 
Tide still rises twice a day 
That's just the ocean's way of getting 
Closer, closer. 
 
As close as today is to tomorrow 
At midnight they can finally touch 
'Cause every minute brings them that much closer 
Closer 
 
So on this silent night 
I call your name 
And suddenly all time and space disappears 
I see your face in firelight 
 
I hold you close in memory 
And even though you're gone 
I know you're here 
As close as the glow is to the ember 
 
You've always been a part of me 
Now living in my heart you're even closer 
Closer. 
I see your face in firelight 
 
I hold you close in memory 
And even though I know you're gone 
I know you're here.... 
As sure as there's snowfall in December 
 
Your love lives in everything 
Summer Winter Fall or Spring 
Every thought of you will bring us closer 
The distance may be large or small 
 
Someday I pray that we may all be 
Closer... 
Closer."

Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me 
Catch a plane, catch a breeze 
On your hands, on your knees 
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me 
On a mule, in a jet 
With your hair in a net 
In a towel when you're wet 
I don't care, this is where you should be 
 
From the hills, from the shore 
Ride the wind to my door 
Turn the high with the dust 
Break the law if you must 
Move the world, only just come back to me 
 
Blast you high, hear me call 
Must i fight city hall 
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me 
What on earth must i do 
Scream and yell till i'm blue 
Curse your soul when will you come back to me? 
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon 
At your rack, at your room 
Mademoiselle, where in hell can you be? 
 
Leave a sign on your door 
Out to lunch ever more 
In a royce or a van, wrapped in mink coats or rain 
Anyway that you can, come back to me 
Hear my voice through the dim 
Feel the waves on your skin 
Like a call from within, come back to me 
Leave behind all your own 
Tell your flowers you will phone 
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me 
 
Let your tub overflow 
If a date waits below 
Let him wait for godot 
By the rail, 
Come by mail, cod 
Par avion, par bateau 
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux 
 
Come by steam, come by gas 
Call for free on a pass 
On the drags and the glass, come back to me 
Leave your bills all unpaid 
Let your bed go unmade 
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me 
Come by sail, come by freight 
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate 
I don't care this is where you should be 
 
Come in pain or in joy 
As a girl, as a boy 
In a bag or a trunk (shut up!) 
On a horse or a drunk 
In the flora or faun, come back to me 
Come back to me, come back...

Noodle soup, poodle soup, 
Talking crows with the croup, 
Almost anything.

Is you don't belong to me

I need you so

Will never free me 
'cause I don't need to touch you 
To feel you, it's so real with you 
 
I just can't get you out of my mind 
But I can remember the last time we tried 
Each needing more than we could give 
And knowing all the time 
A stronger love 
Just can't be found 
Even though at times this crazy world 
Is turning up-side-down 
You'll always belong to me

Except rain comes from the clouds 
 
Sun lights up the sky 
And hummingbirds do fly 
Winter turns to spring 
A wounded heart will heal 
But never much too soon 
 
Yes 
Everything must change 
The young become the old 
And mysteries do unfold 
Cause that's the way of time 
Nothing and no one goes unchanged 
There are not many things in life 
You can be sure of 
Except rain comes from the clouds 
 
Sun lights up the sky 
And butterflies do fly 
Rain comes from the clouds 
Sun lights up the sky 
And music 
And music 
Makes me cry"

Not toy with your morals 
And lead you astray.

I could come to lean on you

Give you your way

When I've got you 
 
Then I only see the sunny side 
Even trouble has its funny side 
When you're gone, my sugar candy

You gotta love him all you can 
And anything he wants from you 
Should be the least that you can do 
Don't let him down 
Just give him love 
Don't let his dreams turn into dust 
He's only tryin' to build a wonderland for two 
If you're the one to share his world 
Just be the someone he can trust 
For the sake of love 
For the love of love 
For pete's sake 
Don't let him down 
Don't let him down

And dream of your diamonds 
Thinkin' you really walk tall 
But livin' and dreamin' when you're alone 
Ain't livin' or dreamin' at all

On September 12th right here, 
In front of Waverley, but unfortunately, 
I lost his address. 
He was last seen with his friend, 
A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles, 
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back. 
I love him but it embarrasses me, 
To walk down the street with him. 
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere, 
And wears a white crash helmet. 
He has gold chains on his leather jacket, 
And on the back are written the names, 
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels"". 
I would gratefully appreciate it, 
If you see him, tell him, 
I'm in the park with my girlfriend. 
And please, 
Tell him Angela and I don't want the 2 dollars back, 
Just him."

And I'm switchen'. 
I'm unhappy with things the way that they've occured. 
It is time to face facts and not mince a word. 
Certain parties with bird-brains are getting the bird. 
Au revior, fare-thee-well and goodbye. And I'll tell you why. 
 
A funny thing happened on my way to love. 
I lost the young fella I've been dreaming of. 
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call, 
To someone who's no fun at all. 
Well, I've stopped forgetting, what else can I do? 
And much thanks for letting me practise on you. 
It's farewell my lovely, excuse, please, my dust. 
Unravel and travel I must. 
No tears, no hurt surprise, 
It's with a pleasant glow I realise. 
If I have that much love so deep, true and strong. 
All ready to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong. 
Then think of the treasures, the joy and delight, 
I'll give to my own Mr. Right. 
My own Mr. Right. 
So asta la vista, ta-ta, toodle-oo, 
The world will keep turning but not around you. 
There's someone else waiting that's more than a friend. 
Best wishes and dishes I'll send. 
And so, so-long, I'm on my way. 
Thanks for the buggy-ride and may I say - 
If I have that much love so deep true and strong. 
Already to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong.

One summer night 
With nothing left to say 
 
We let the dream begin 
It was carried on the wind 
And it wandered away 
 
One golden sky 
One spark of light 
Forever will remain 
 
And the song of the storm 
Brought us close, kept us warm 
All alone making love 
In the rain 
 
Gone is the world outside 
Home on the turning tide 
True love will find the sun 
And know the reason why 
 
You make me hunger for 
You whispered, ""Mi amor"" 
Over the ocean's roar 
And the night will become 
Our golden dawn 
 
Two hearts as one 
No tears to cry 
With you I have it all 
 
If love can never die 
I'm not afraid to fly 
But how far must I fall 
 
One silver song 
One lullaby 
For all the love we make 
 
It's the look in your eyes 
It's the moon on the rise 
It's the sound of the heart 
That you break 
 
Gone is the dark of night 
Call on the early glow 
Send down the birds of love 
That circle us below 
 
And still I will hunger for 
You whispering, ""Mi amor"" 
Over the ocean's roar 
And your arms reach for me 
 
And the shine on the sea 
And the night will become 
Our golden dawn"

Every man would have a friend 
That right would always win

The innocence of youth 
Maybe only in that blind belief 
Can we ever find the truth

Braiding wild flowers 
And leaves in her hair 
Picked up a pencil and wrote 
""I love you"" 
 
In my finest hand 
I wanted to send it 
But I don't know where I stand 
 
Telephone 
Even the sound of your voice is still new 
All alone in California 
 
I'm talking to you 
I'm feeling too foolish and strange 
To say the words that I had planned 
I guess it's too early 
 
'Cause I don't know where I stand 
Crickets call courting the ladies 
In starred apple green thickets tall 
 
Until the morning 
Comes up like a dream 
How muted and misty 
Such rouse and I'll take 
What sleep I can 
I know that I miss you 
But I don't know where I stand 
I know that I miss you 
But I don't know where I stand"

Some part of the evening 
And that's the way I live through the day 
 
I had myself a true love, but now he's gone 
And left me for good 
The lord knows I don't hear those back yard 
Whispers going round the neighborhood 
 
There maybe a lot of things I miss 
A lot of things I don't know 
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love 
And once upon a time I had a true love 
 
In the evening, in the doorway 
While I stand there and wait for his coming 
With the house swept and the clothes hung 
And a pot on the stove where I had meal 
 
Where is he while I waste the rising newel? 
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon? 
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now? 
And everybody keeps telling me 
 
There are may be a lot of things I miss 
A lot of things I don't know

A little bit more than me

No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide.

Could have played things some other way. 
Learn about the man before I fell 
I was just a little careless 
But I was ever so much younger then. 
I was so much younger then 
Now at least I know I know him well 
Wasn't it good? Oh so good

I remember sky. 
It was blue as ink 
Or at least I think 
I remember sky 
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks 
Coming down like lint 
And it made you squint when the wind would blow 
And ice like vinyl on the streets 
Cold as silver, white as sheets 
Rain like strings and changing things 
Like leaves 
I remember leaves 
Green as spearmint 
Crisp as paper 
I remember trees 
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas 
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos 
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes 
Light and noise and bees and boys 
And daaaaays, oh! 
I remember days or at least I try 
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze 
And the bluest ink isn't really sky. 
And at times I think I would gladly die 
For a day of sky!"

I'd walk away like a movie star 
Who gets spurned in a three-way script 
Ends up number two 
The movie queen to play the scene 
And bringing all the good things out in me 
But now for love, lets be real 
I never thought I could feel this way 
And I got to say 
That I just don't get it 
I don't know where we went wrong 
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back 
 
If you could read my mind, love 
What a tale my thoughts could tell 
Just like an old time movie 
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well 
 
In a castle dark or a fortress strong 
With chains upon my feet 
Stories always end 
And if you read between the lines 
You know that I'm just trying to understand 
The feelings that you lack 
I've never thought I could feel this way 
And I've got to say 
That I just don't get it 
I don't know where we went wrong 
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back"

At Palisades in Salisbury park the roller coasters are flyin 
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin' 
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground 
Then take her on the Twirl-A-Way and spin her around 
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day 
 
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day 
And Disneyland and p.o.p. is worth a trip to L.A. 
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad 
And I'll bet the laughin' lady makes you laugh like mad 
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA 
 
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the beach boy circus. 
The best little show in town. 
Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of
a dollar. 
Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (is it real?) 
She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a snake. 
(she looks like a fake to me) (let's go see her) (it costs too much) 
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella. 
She shimmies, she shakes 
 
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's Steel Pier 
You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors 
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride 
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side 
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day"

Does she remember 
That I can't forget 
Does she know I regret 
I never told her how I 
I wanted to hold her 
I just let her go 
Lonely nights thinkin' 
It's starting to sink in 
We had a way to go 
We'll grow closer together 
By being apart 
When my angel comes home 
It's been hell bein' here alone 
God tell me, why has she flown 
So far away 
I pray she won't stay another day 
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home 
Please come home

Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea

Crimson sunsets and golden dawns 
A mother deer with their newborn fawns 
All under Big Sur skies

That's where I belong. 
 
Big Sur I've got plans for you 
Me and mine are going to 
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers 
(Big Sur mount) 
 
And live in canyons covered in springtime green 
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen 
And with my old guitar 
I'll make up songs to sing. 
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside 
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside 
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide 
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be 
Where the rugged mountain meets the water 
 
And so while stars shine brightly from up above 
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove 
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log. 
 
From time to time I must go away 
The thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay 
Away from Big Sur 
Oh Big Sur"

And we'll have some fun 
Now before i melt away""

With a broomstick in his hand 
Running here and there 
All around the square 
Saying, ""catch me if you can""

The streets of town 
Right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment 
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""

And the gods lay down in defeat

That I'm giving 
Giving to you can you dig

I want to live 
To learn the truth before my door 
Don't you know 
I'm a simple man for all I know 
This might be the hard way 
But it's easier for me 
To take all the changes that are always amazin' 
But to never let 'em fence me in

That I'm giving 
Giving to you can you dig

I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds 
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams 
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water 
And I can barely barely breathe

Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now 
You know you ought to take it slower 
But you just can't wait to get to know her 
 
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing 
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring 
 
It makes you feel so bad 
It makes your heart feel sad 
It makes your days go wrong 
It makes your nights so long 
 
You've got to keep in mind love is here today 
And it's gone tomorrow 
It's here and gone so fast 
 
Right now you think that she's perfection 
This time is really an exception 
Well you know I hate to be a downer 
But I'm the guy she left before you found her 
 
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her 
But I keep on remembering things like they were 
 
She made me feel so bad 
She made my heart feel sad 
She made my days go wrong 
And made my nights so long 
 
You've got to keep in mind love is here today

Sometimes it's hard to find my way 
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days 
When your friends have all gone 
Leaving this town for another one 
The night is coming round 
I can feel the weight of coming down, 
So afraid to lose this dream 
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can 
It's so easy to lose my way 
Lay your head where you may find some peace 
I've been searching for my happiness 
Don't you want to wake up and take my love, 
I'd be happy if you'd let me know 
Should I stay or go 
Let me know 
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, 
Of new realities, 
Heavenly angels won't you guide me

Meant for me.

For my monster from his slab, began to rise 
And suddenly to my surprise 
He did the mash, he did the monster mash 
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash 
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash 
He did the mash, he did the monster mash 
From my laboratory in the castle east 
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast 
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes 
To get a jolt from my electrodes 
They did the mash , they did the monster mash 
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash 
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash 
They did the mash , they did the monster mash

Dancin' across the dance floor 
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout 
Turn around and help the monster turn it out 
Get down with the monster mash 
Get down with the monster mash 
Get down with the monster mash 
Get down with the monster mash 
And if you don't have core hard cash 
You can still do the monster mash 
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds 
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds 
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive 
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five' 
They played the mash, they played the monster mash 
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash 
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash 
They played the mash, they played the monster mash 
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring 
Seems he was troubled by just one thing 
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said 
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist? 
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash 
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash 
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see.

It will be a home for me.

She'd rather be alone

Just for a moment I could really make you mine 
Just for a while turn back the hands of time 
If I could only hold you now

In the wind 
And too long in the rain 
Taking any comfort that I can 
 
Looking back and hoping for 
The freedom of my chains 
And lying in your loving arms again 
 
If you could see me now 
Singing somewhere through the lonely night 
And dreaming of the love that held me tight 
If you could only see me now 
 
Cause I've been too long in the wind 
And too long in the rain 
Taking any comfort that I can 
 
Looking back and hoping for 
The freedom of my chains 
And lying in your loving arms again 
 
I can almost feel your loving arms again 
I can almost feel your loving arms again"

Don't look under the tree 
The one thing we're looking for 
Is something we can't see 
Far more precious than silver 
And more splendid than gold 
Is something to treasure 
But is something we can't hold 
 
As long as there's Christmas 
I truly believe 
That hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We'll receive (we'll receive) 
 
As we all pray together 
It's the time to rejoice 
And though we may look different 
We are singing with one voice 
 
As Long As there's Christmas 
I truly believe 
That hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We'll recieve 
 
There is more (so much more) 
To this time of year (to this time of year) 
Than sleigh bells and holly 
Mistletoes and snow 
Those things will come and go 
Come and goooo 
 
As long as there is Christmas 
I truly do believe that 
Hope is the greatest of the gifts 
We will receive (we'll receive) 
 
As Long As there's Christmas 
I truly believe (I truly believe) 
That hope is the greatest of the gifts

Belle, I have something to show you. 
But first, you have to close your eyes.

Knowing now, that this was indeed the legendary sword called ""Excalibur,""
Arthur tried to pull it from the stone. He tried 
Once to no avail. He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out.
Then, for the third time, Arthur drew forth the 
Sword...

Small to say the least 
Both a little scared 
Neither one prepared

Ever a surprise 
Ever as before 
Ever just as sure

People laugh and people cry. 
Every morning the clock strikes eight. 
I go to work. 
I close the gate. 
And on my way, I sing a song. 
About my wife, where I belong. 
 
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather 
If it's rain they anticipate 
Baby make no mistake 
Yes the storm will break but never me you see. 
Two years on two years on 
But only you can see me. 
Only you can see me. 
 
For what I've got 
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not 
For I am he with something more 
It's you and I reality.

Truth behind the lies.

Let this be my prayer, to keep you safe when I'm not there. 
 
Can we love and live apart? 
I don't know, no, I don't know. 
How can we divide the heart? 
I don't know, no, I don't know. 
 
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls, 
I long for your embrace. 
And in the cold night, under the street light, 
I long for your embrace. 
 
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith). 
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word. 
Embrace. 
 
Through the mists of time, lovers can be friends. 
The power of the human heart. 
The secrets in the souls of men. 
All my blessings in disguise. 
I don't know, no, I don't know. 
Reunited we will rise. 
I don't know, no, I don't know. 
 
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls, 
I long for your embrace. 
And in the cold night, under the street light,

Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith). 
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word. 
 
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls, 
I long for your embrace. 
Another daybreak, another heartache, 
I long for your embrace. 
 
Living separate lives, 
Away from you. 
Embrace, embrace. 
The lonely, lonely life. 
Lonely days and nights (away from you). 
We can live our life 
(embrace, embrace) 
With our separate lives. 
Embrace, embrace. 
The lonely, lonely lives. 
Lonely days and nights. 
I will never send away. 
Embrace, embrace. 
The lonely, lonely lives. 
Embrace the child inside 
The lonely, lonely lives."

to make up for all the things that I would lose 
If I lay down my life , for my King and country men 
Would it change you for the better 
It better be all right 
To be always like children 
Afraid of the night 
 
Well you better get busy , get it over and done 
I was here when you arrived , I'll be here when you're gone 
If I give up my life for my King and country men 
Would it change you for the better 
It better be all right 
To be never like people

Bee Gees,Life Goes On,/b/bee+gees/life+goes+on_20015927.html,"Pardon me, if I use you in my dreams 
You throw those angel eyes at me 
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems 
But she is not in love with me 
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away 
A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are 
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her 
It's got to be growing 
I can't wait no longer 
 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
When love goes wrong only love knows why 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams , we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I 
 
Suddenly, all the world gets in the way 
You disappear into the crowd 
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came 
But I still call your name out loud 
I want to know you , but I never met you 
Reality can be cruel 
If a wandering soul meets another 
They shouldn't be separated 
Better in love with your head on my shoulder 
But I'll never be satisfied 
And if I can't see you 
 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
When love goes wrong, only love knows why 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I 
 
Living your life in someone else's heart 
A lover's dream that has no end 
There may be somebody you can base your world upon 
I'll never be the same again 
And there's a part of me here 
And there's a part of me with you 
But all of me loves you 
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me 
I'm so proud of 
All of my days I will be here for you 
And the love keeps running 
And if I can't hold you 
 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
And there's a million words for the one goodbye 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I 
 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
And there's a million words for the one goodbye 
Life goes on for the lonely man 
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons 
You and I, I"

But be alive, I know that we will. 
The world keeps on moving but I'm holding still. 
 
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny. 
That would arrive the moment you're born. 
For we will be here when the miracle comes. 
 
[Chorus:] 
Living eyes when under the sun don't cry. 
No war in my mind. 
The state of my heart. 
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall. 
The day I deny the face of my love. 
 
[Bridge:] 
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever. 
Right now when the power is mine. 
I leave you Heaven and the Earth, I leave you never. 
And living to love is the reason to shine. 
 
I been over I been under I don't own a dream to analyze. 
But living eyes you know that I do. 
Believe in the soul and the magic of you.

'N sat on the side of the bed 
He said, ""I'm leaving you, baby""

I said, ""I can't make you stay if you want to go 
But it's high time, baby, that you should know 
 
One monkey don't stop no show 
One monkey don't stop no show 
So, if you still want to go, go ahead""

Dry, long and slow 
But I found out somethin' a long time ago 
 
One monkey don't stop no show 
One monkey don't stop no show 
So if he gets too big for his pants 
You better spring that new one and give him a chance 
 
I used to be chicken hearted 
Cry when he'd walk out the door 
'Cause I was just young and stupid 
Ha! Ain't like that no more 
'Cause I had a hard way to go 
But I learned the score 
And I'm here to tell you 
 
One monkey don't stop no show

Let him do anything he choose 
There's a million men who can fill his shoes

These three words which transpire: 
 
She told me that only in Miami

Only in Miami. 
My story, she goes this way. 
Fish may fly through the purple keys, 
Golden birds take to air. 
I am bound to the earth, it seems. 
My life can be so unfair. 
Only in Miami

Only in Miami 
Is Cuba so far away. 
 
Standing on the shoreline waiting, 
Everyone anticipating. 
I can hear the broken hearted say, 
Only in Miami 
Is Cuba so far away. 
 
And she cries for her child without a mother. 
And she cries for her son without a father. 
And she cries for herself without a lover. 
Can't face another day. 
Chase the blues away. 
I thought I heard her mumble as she 
Turned away 
 
Only in Miami 
Is Cuba so far away.

She was thirty-one and I was seventeen 
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything

And wondered what the coming night would bring 
 
The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky 
And it started to swelter 
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown 
And I thought it would melt her 
 
She threw back her hair like I wasn't there 
And she sipped on a Julep 
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare 
When I looked at her two lips 
 
And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say 
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say 
But stay with me until the sun has gone away 
And I will chase the boy in you away 
 
And then she smiled and we talked for a while 
Then we walked for a mile to the sea 
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand

Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed 
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need 
I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed 
 
It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance 
It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance 
It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give 
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live 
 
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long 
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong 
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow 
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose."

Or will I be among the missing? 
 
Maybe it's much too early in the game 
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same 
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve? 
 
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight 
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night? 
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve

The orange and palm trees sway. 
There's never been such a day 
In Beverly Hills, L.A. 
 
But it's December the twenty fourth, 
And I am longing to be up north. 
 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
Just like the ones I used to know. 
Where the treetops glisten and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow. 
 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, 
With every Christmas card I write. 
May your days be merry and bright, 
And may all your Christmases be white. 
 
May your days be merry and bright, 
And may all your Christmases, 
All your Christmases, 
All your Christmases be white."

Looking up at the people looking down 
Taking tranquilizers by the pound 
Looking down at the people looking up 
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough 
 
Ah, but that green grass on the other side 
Is just an illusion 
We all have our own confusion 
 
Rich people watching the people poor 
Trying to figure out how to get some more 
Poor people watching people rich 
You know, they call them dirty you-know-which 
 
Ugly people watching the people pretty 
Say they can't get down to the nitty-gritty 
Pretty people watching people ugly 
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me

Make me cry?

Think of it as being a great big rock 
Won't you think before you started to roll it down 
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop 
 
I've given all I have to give 
And if you don't want me 
I don't want to live

A fine romance, you won't wrestle 
I might as well play bridge 
With my old maid aunt 
I haven't got a chance 
This is a fine romance 
 
A fine romance, my good fellow 
You take romance, I'll take jello 
You're calmer than the seals 
In the Arctic Ocean 
At least they flap their fins 
To express emotion 
A fine romance with no quarrels 
With no insults and all morals 
I've never mussed the crease 
In your blue serge pants 
I never get the chance 
This is a fine romance"

No, I rather have nothing at all 
But, please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek 
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall 
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak 
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall 
And if I fell under the spell of your call 
I would be caught in the undertow

Let them know that I'm glad to go.

With the last breath of my soul, 
I'll be blessin' you.

Happens all the time 
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh 
 
And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin' 
The grass keeps growin' 
You gotta keep goin' 
And the Lord have mercy on your soul 
La, la la la."
Billy Joel,All For Leyna,/b/billy+joel/all+for+leyna_20072883.html,"She stood on the tracks 
Waving her arms 
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK 
Quick as a wink 
She changed her mind. 
She gave me a night 
That's all it was 
What will it take until I STOP 
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa 
There's nothing else I can do 
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna 
I don't want anyone new 
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna 
There?s nothing in it for you 
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna 
We laid on the beach 
Watching the tide 
She didn't tell me there were ROCKS 
Under the waves 
Right off the shore. 
Washed up on the sand 
Barely alive 
Wishing the undertow would STOP 
How can a man take anymore, whoa 
There's nothing else I can do 
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna. 
I don't want anyone new 
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna. 
There's nothing in it for you 
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna. 
I'm failing in school 
Losing my friends 
Making my family lose their minds 
I don't want to eat 
I don't want to sleep 
I only want Leyna, one more time. 
Now, I'm in my room 
Watching the tube 
Telling myself, she still may DROP 
Over to say, she's changed her mind 
So, I wait in the dark 
Listening for her 
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP 
Kidding yourself, wasting your time. 
There's nothing else I can do 
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna 
I don't want anyone new 
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna 
There's nothing in it for you 
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna

Billy Joel,Angry Young Man,/b/billy+joel/angry+young+man_20072938.html,"There's a place in the world for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
 
Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
 
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right. 
 
And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
He's honest and pure and has courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.

Billy Joel,Blonde Over Blue,/b/billy+joel/blonde+over+blue_20073017.html,"Some days when I'm far away 
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion 
Some nights when I'm wound so tight 
There is no release, there is no solution 
In hell there's a big hotel 
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open 
No phone so you can't call home 
And the TV works, but the clicker is broken 
But in the darkness I see your light turned on 
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to 
CHORUS 
Blonde over blue 
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire 
Blonde over blue 
They shine as though you're burning inside 
One word from you is all I need to be inspired 
Blonde over blue 
I need your inspiration tonight 
These days there's a million ways 
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected 
These times there are sins and crimes 
On the morning shows for the disconnected 
I look and I write my book 
And I walk away with the wrong impressions 
I don't care 'cause I've done my share 
And I need some time for my own obsessions 
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by 
It's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you 
CHORUS 
These days not a damn soul prays 
And there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in 
These days only good luck pays 
If we don't get paid then we try to get even 
I look and I write my book 
And I have my say and I draw conclusions 
Some nights when I'm wound so tight 
There is no release, there is no solution 
But in the darkness I see your light turned on 
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

Billy Joel,Careless Talk,/b/billy+joel/careless+talk_20072864.html,"Careless talk 
That's what you heard about me 
Jealous talk 
That's what I heard about you 
Everybody's telling lies 
I don't even know why 
Why can't people 
Find something better to do 
Careless talk 
I don't believe what they say 
I heard them talk 
They say you've been putting me down 
In the shadows on the phone 
They won't leave us alone 
They've been talking 
Ever since you came around 
Careless talk 
Telling you I'm doing wrong 
Jealous talk 
Follows wherever you go 
I'm aware of what you heard 
Every terrible word 
Everybody's making believe that they know 
All of the intimate things 
That we ever might have said 
In the heat of a passionate moment 
In a conversation shared 
For the ears of nobody else 
There are some things they will never hear 
There are secrets I'll never tell 
Careless talk 
Going around on the streets 
Jealous talk 
I know how bad it can be 
Let them stand where they fall 
They don't know us at all 
All that talking won't make a difference to me

Billy Joel,Christie Lee,/b/billy+joel/christie+lee_20072865.html,"Let me tell you a story 
About a woman and a man 
Maybe you will find familiar 
Maybe you won't understand 
The man's name I don't remember 
He was always Joe to me 
But I can't forget the woman 
She was always Christie Lee 
He was working in a night club 
That's where he played the saxophone 
He used to fake to stock arrangements 
He left the customers alone 
But one night before the last song 
About a quarter after three 
He saw her standing at the coat check 
And made his move on Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee 
She was a nice piece of music 
She had a rhythm all her own 
He blew a solo like a blind man 
She really dug his saxophone 
She wanted more than just an encore 
And he could play in every key 
He left the stage and packed his alto 
And took it home with Christie Lee 
Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the Bible 
You know the man could blow an educated axe 
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman 
Who didn't need another lover 
All she wanted was the sax 
It took a while for him to notice 
It took a while for him to see 
He was never in control here 
It was always Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee 
Oh the man took a calculated gamble 
Yes the man had the power to perform 
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle 
She didn't need him as a man 
All she wanted was the horn 
They say that Joe became a wino 
They say he always drinks alone 
They say he stumbles like a blind man 
They say he sold his saxophone 
Even the band must face the music 
That's what the moral is to me 
The only time you hit the high note 
Is when you play for Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee 
Christie Lee, Christie Lee"
Billy Joel,Christmas In Fallujah,/b/billy+joel/christmas+in+fallujah_21043074.html,"It's evening in the desert 
I'm tired and I'm cold 
But I am just a soldier 
I do what I am told 
 
We came with the crusaders 
To save the holy land 
It's Christmas in Fallujah 
And no one gives a damn 
 
And I just got your letter 
And this is what I read you said 
I'm fading from your memory 
So I'm just as good as dead 
 
We are the armies of the empire 
We are ethe legionnaires of Rome 
 
It's Christmas in Fallujah 
And we ain't never coming home 
We came to bring these people freedom 
We came to fight the infidel 
There is no justice in the desert 
Because there is no God in hell 
 
They say Osama's in the mountains 
Deep in a cave near Pakistan 
But there's a sea of blood in Baghdad 
A sea of oil in the sand 
Between the Tigris and Euphrates 
Another day comes to an end 
It's Christmas in Fallujah 
Piece on Earth goodwill to men 
 
It's Christmas in Fallujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
It's Christmas in Fallujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
It's Christmas in Fallujah

The bums drop dead and the dogs go mad 
In packs on the West Side 
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide 
She wants to hit those bricks 
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline 
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place 
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face 
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound 
I don't want to hear it but he won't turn it down 
Life is tough but it's just enough 
To hold back the tears until it's closing time 
I survived, I'm still alive 
But I'm getting close to the borderline 
Close to the borderline 
 
A buck three eighty 
Won't buy you much lately on the street these days 
And when you can get gas 
You know you can't drive fast anymore on the parkways 
Rich man, poor man, either way American 
Shoved into the lost and found 
The no-nukes yell we're gonna all go to hell 
With the next big meltdown 
I got remote control and a color T.V. 
I don't change channels so they must change me 
I got real close friends that will get me high 
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try 
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry 
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time 
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy 
But I'm getting close to the borderline 
Close to the borderline 
 
I thought I'd sacrificed so many things 
I thought I'd thrown them all away 
I didn't think I needed anything 
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay 
 
I need a doctor for my pressure pills 
I need a lawyer for my medical bills 
I need a banker to finance my home 
But I need security to back my loan 
It isn't new what I'm going through 
But everybody knows you got to break sometime 
Another night I fought the good fight 
But I'm getting closer to the borderline 
Closer to the borderline"

Should be over now 
Everybody wants to hear the secrets 
That you never told a soul before 
And it's not that strange 
Because it wouldn't change 
What happened anyhow 
But you swore to yourself a long time ago 
There were some things that people never needed to know 
Guess there's one that you keep 
That you bury so deep 
No one can tear it out 
And you can't talk about it 
Because you're following a code of silence 
You're never gonna to lose the anger 
You just deal with it a different way 
And you can't talk about it

To be living by a code of silence 
When you've really got a lot to say 
You don't want to lose a friendship 
There's nothing that you have to hide 
And a little dirt 
Couldn't hurt no one anyway 
And you still have a rage inside you 
That you carry with a certain pride 
In the only part of the broken heart 
That you could ever save 
But you've been through it once 
You know how it ends 
You don't see the point 
Of going through it again 
And this ain't the place 
And this ain't the time 
And neither's any other day

To be living by a code of silence 
When you've really got a lot to say 
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons 
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break 
Some things unknown are best left alone forever 
And if a vow is what it takes 
Haven't you paid for your mistakes 
After the moment passes 
And the impulse disappears 
You can still hold back 
Because you don't crack very easily 
It's a time honored resolution 
Because the danger is always near 
It's with you now 
But that ain't how it was supposed to be 
And it's hard to believe after all these years 
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears 
And you feel like a fool 
Because it's part of your rules 
You've got a memory 
But you can't talk about it 
Because you're following a code of silence 
You're never gonna to lose the anger 
You just deal with it a different way

To keep the conversation light 
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind

I put my foot in my mouth

If I need some room to escape 
When the moment arose 
I'd tell her it's all a mistake 
 
But that's not how I feel 
No that's not the woman I've known

Just when I'm in a serious mood 
She is suddenly quiet and shy 
 
Leave a tender moment 
Leave it alone

To hold my emotions inside 
To change the attitude tonight 
I've run out of places to hide 
 
And if that's how I feel

She understands the things you're doin' 
She's a modern woman 
 
Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment 
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why 
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper 
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy 
 
But times have changed 
Things are not the same, baby 
You overcame such a bad attitude 
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks 
And nowadays it's politics 
And after 1986 what else could we do? 
 
You got to learn to relax 
And face the facts of modern woman 
And you're an old fashioned man 
She understands the things you're doin' 
She's a modern woman"

Billy Joel,Scandinavian Skies,/b/billy+joel/scandinavian+skies_20073011.html,"The sins of Amsterdam 
Were still a recent surprise 
And we were flying over 
Scandinavian Skies 
We climbed towards the sun 
We turned and cursed as one 
We pulled the shades 
And closed our eyes 
The Stockholm city lights 
Were slowly starting to rise 
And we were strapped against 
Those Scandinavian skies 
The landing gear came down 
And touched the Swedish ground 
And we were all so paralyzed 
On the plane 
We were mainly sound and lights 
In the veins 
We could play the blues all night 
The tour of Germany 
Was bleeding into our eyes 
And we were sailing over 
Scandinavian skies 
We had the Midas touch 
Until we met the Dutch 
And they exhausted our supplies 
Who's to pay? 
For this international flight 
Who could stay 
We were only there for the night 
We watched the power fall 
Inside the Olso hall 
While all the cold Norweigians cried 
Who could say 
What was left and where was right? 
By the way 
I could play the blues all night

There's a storm front coming (mood indigo) 
White water running and the pressure is low 
Storm front coming (mood indigo) 
Small craft warning on the radio 
I've been sailing a long time on this ocean 
Man gets lonesome, all those years at sea 
I've got a woman, my life should be easy 
Most men hunger for the life I lead 
The morning was gray, but I had the motivation 
I drifted away and ran into more 
Heavy weather off shore 
CHORUS 
We've got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze 
We've got a falling barometer and rising seas 
We've got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale 
We've got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale 
I'm still restless for the open water 
Though she gives me everything I need 
She asked me to stay, but I'd done my navigation 
I drove her away, but I should have known 
To stay tied up at home

But they're the only times I've ever known 
And I believe there is a time for meditation 
In cathedrals of our own 
 
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes 
But I can only stand apart and sympathize 
For we are always what our situations hand us 
It's either sadness or euphoria 
 
So we'll argue and we'll compromise 
And realize that nothing's ever changed 
For all our mutual experience 
Our separate conclusions are the same 
 
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity 
Our reason coexists with our insanity 
Though we choose between reality and madness 
It's either sadness or euphoria 
 
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies 
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies 
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities 
It's either sadness or euphoria"

And the impulse disappearsyou can still hold back 
Because you don't crack very easilyit's a time-honored resolution 
Because the danger is always nearit's with you now

Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean 
It coasts too much and takes too long to find out too late 
Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken 
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective 
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken

Too many pieces means you're touching too much 
You never win if you can't play it straight 
You only beat me if you get me to hate 
It must be so lonely to think that you have only 
Somebody elses life to live if they let you 
I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective 
To find out how fast your friends will forget you

This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen 
I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking 
Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective 
Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?

This is the time to remember

To hold on to 
Cause we won't 
Although we'll want to 
This is the time 
But time is gonna change

And now I need the rest of you 
 
Did you know that before you came into my life 
It was some kind of miracle that I survived 
Some day we will both look back 
And have to laugh 
We lived through a lifetime 
And the aftermath 
 
This is the time to remember 
Cause it will not last forever 
These are the days 
To hold on to 
Cause we won't 
Although we want to 
This is the time 
But time is gonna change

But I don't want to lose you know

To let a day 
Slip on by 
Without even seeing each other at all 
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I 
And those will be the days you can never recall 
 
And so we embrace again 
Behind the dunes 
This beach is cold 
On winter afternoons 
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun 
I'm warm from the memory of days to come 
 
This is the time to remember 
Cause it will not last forever 
These are the days 
To hold on to 
But we won't

Never thought I'd do before 
But if the strain brings happiness,

More or less.

Push those buttons and answer that phone

Just nothing but kisses

Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue 
Prayed each night for someone

Why should we spend money 
On a show or two 
No one does those love scenes 
Exactly like you 
 
You make me feel so grand 
I want to hand the world to you 
I hope you'll understand 
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin' 
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true 
She meant me for someone

She lies 'neath the clover 
Someone caught her bending over 
 
Picking up a daisy

This is a wrong that needs a righting 
Let's get that funeral service over 
So then we can start in a-feuding again 
 
Feuding and fighting and a-fussing 
That's all that's going on with using 
We are such neighborly people peaceful and sweet 
All except when we happen to meet 
Daughter, baby daughter 
 
Poisoned all the neighbors chickens 
Daughter hadn't oughter 
Least until she could run like the dickens

And go feuding and fighting some more"

You've never mussed the crease in my blue serge pants 
You never take a chance, this is a fine romance 
 
A fine romance, my good fellow 
You take romance, I'll take Jello 
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean 
At least they flap their fins to express emotion 
 
A fine romance, my dear Duchess 
Two old fogies, we really need crutches 
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce) 
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance

They're just like cactus plants, (oh boy)

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

He was made of snow but the children know 
That he came to life one day 
 
There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found 
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around 
 
Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be 
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me 
 
Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump 
Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump 
Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow 
 
Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day 
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now, before I melt away"" 
 
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand 
Runnin' here and there, all around the square 
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can"" 
 
He led them down the streets of town 
Right to the traffic cop 
He only paused a moment 
When he heard him holler, ""Stop"" 
 
Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way 
But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Don't you cry 
I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day 
I'll be back again some day"""

Though many, many times I see 
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

To where your heart will feel no pain 
And when the fields are fresh and green 
I'll take you to your home again! 
 
To that dear home beyond the sea 
My Kathleen shall again return. 
And when thy old friends welcome thee 
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn. 
Where laughs the little silver stream 
Beside your mother's humble cot 
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam 
There all your grief will be forgot.

Could make me be true, could make me be blue

Some others I've seen might never be mean 
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do

Keeps his darling in suspense 
And he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe 
That's because it's the natural thing to do 
 
And you know every dove 
Has its heart set on love 
Rabbits, too, pet and pat 
And there's nothing wrong with that 
 
When a boy such as I 
Tries so hard to qualify 
With a very lovely lady such as you 
Can't you see it's the natural thing to do 
 
And then the girl she acts demure 
The boy he feels proud and sure 
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous 
Fine thing 
That's because it's the natural thing to do 
 
But the girl she just won't agree 
She whimpers and she simpers 
And he begs on bended knee 
But she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue 
The chump 
That's because it's the natural thing to do 
 
Then the boy in despair 
Waves his arms, tears his hair 
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad 
Then you know that he's got it bad 
 
Then the girl she ought to fall 
If she's got a heart at all 
She should take him in her arms 
And kiss him too 
Oh! Oh! Just the natural thing to do"

It's my universe 
Even with an empty purse 
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams

For a road where nature trods 
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight 
In goldenrods

In days of old when nights were bold 
Fair ladies were enraptured 
By stirring deeds of chivalry and daring. 
But nowadays in other ways 
Sweet maids are one encaptured 
You'll hear the best authorities declaring 
Learn to croon 
Ya da da dee da da da da 
La da da da dee da da da 
La da da da dee 
Just murmur da da dee da da da dee 
And when you do 
She answer da da dee da da dee dee 
And nestle closer to you 
Learn to croon 
You'll eliminate each rival soon 
If you're heading for a sunny honeymoon

But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 
It doesn't show signs of stopping 
And I brought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 
When we finally kiss goodnight 
How I'll hate to go out in the storm 
But if you really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm 
 
The fire is slowly dying 
And, my dear, we're still goodbying 
But as long as you love me so 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"

Bing Crosby,Swingin' Down The Lane,/b/bing+crosby/swingin+down+the+lane_20822921.html,"Everybody hand in hand 
Swingin' down the lane 
Everybody's feelin' grand 
Swingin' down the lane 
 
That's the time I miss that bliss 
That we might have known 
Nights like this when I'm all alone 
 
When the moon is on the rise 
Honey, I am so blue 
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes 
Like we used to do 
 
When the moon is on the way 
Still I'm waitin' all in vain 
Should be swingin' down that lane with you 
 
When the moon is on the rise 
Honey, I am so blue 
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes 
Like we used to do 
 
When the moon is on the way 
Still I'm waitin' all in vain 
Should be swingin' down that lane with you"
Bing Crosby,Swinging on A Star,/b/bing+crosby/swinging+on+a+star_20528299.html,"Would you like to swing on a star 
Carry moonbeams home in a jar 
And be better off than you are 
Or would you rather be a mule 
 
A mule is an animal with long funny ears 
Kicks up at anything he hears 
His back is brawny but his brain is weak 
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak 
And by the way, if you hate to go to school 
You may grow up to be a mule 
 
Or would you like to swing on a star 
Carry moonbeams home in a jar 
And be better off than you are 
Or would you rather be a pig 
 
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face 
His shoes are a terrible disgrace 
He has no manners when he eats his food 
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude 
But if you don't care a feather or a fig 
You may grow up to be a pig 
 
Or would you like to swing on a star 
Carry moonbeams home in a jar 
And be better off than you are 
Or would you rather be a fish 
 
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook 
He can't write his name or read a book 
To fool the people is his only thought 
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught 
But then if that sort of life is what you wish 
You may grow up to be a fish 
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish 
 
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo 
Every day you meet quite a few 
So you see it's all up to you 
You can be better than you are 
You could be swingin' on a star"
Bing Crosby,Thanks,/b/bing+crosby/thanks_20315286.html,"We used to dwell in love's own palace 
A palace of dreams come true 
Now that we're through I bear no malice 
Though we've called it a day 
All I can say is 
Thanks for all the lovely delights 
I found in your embrace. 
I'm thankful though I know 
It's ending all too soon 
And thanks for unforgettable nights 
I never can replace 
And memories that linger like a haunting tune 
It is better to have loved you dear and lost 
Than never to have loved at all 
Yes it's better, for no matter what the cost 
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day 
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise 
We lost our road, but still I must convey our thanks 
 
It is better to have loved you dear and lost 
Than never to have loved at all

Black Sabbath,After All,/b/black+sabbath/after+all_20019317.html,"What do you say to the dead 
Will you forgive me for living 
Can't believe the things that they said 
Wonderful day for a killing 
It's killing me 
 
What do they do with your soul 
Is it just lying there busted 
When did you lose all control 
Is there someone to be trusted 
With my mind 
 
Oh there's insufficient evidence 
Of what just might come after 
But sometimes out of nowhere 
There's demented sounds of laughter 
 
Are we all haunted by 
The ghost - imagination 
It just can't be 
I've seen them there 
Howling at the moon 
 
Is it just me 
Or does somebody else believe this 
Well I'm not alone 
And I'm not afraid 
There's just one way to see 
 
Chorus: 
After all etc. 
 
What do you say to the dead 
Is there a place where it's burning 
It says in a book I once read 
Yes there's a chance of returning 
Turn to me 
 
The fundamental principles 
Say nothing of forever 
But those are voices that I hear 
Or I'm just not so clever 
 
It can't be me 
I know somebody else believes this 
Well I'm not alone 
I'm not afraid 
Just one way to see 
 
After all etc."
Black Sabbath,After Forever,/b/black+sabbath/after+forever_20019384.html,"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved? 
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave 
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you? 
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school? 
 
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool? 
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a
fool? 
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways 
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days 
 
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say 
If they knew you believe in God above? 
They should realize before they criticize 
that God is the only way to love 
 
Is your mind so small that you have to fall 
In with the pack wherever they run 
Will you still sneer when death is near 
And say they may as well worship the sun? 
 
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ 
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced 
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe? 
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve 
 
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone 
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one 
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate 
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late."

Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls 
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time 
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind 
 
In days of romance 
She was the queen of dance 
She'd dance the night away 
 
And as the seasons turn the days to years 
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers 
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen 
And now she dances only in her dreams 
 
In days of romance 
She was the queen of dance 
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away"

Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see 
So tell me people, am I going insane?

I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead 
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me 
 
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine 
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been 
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room 
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom 
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me 
 
Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going 
Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised? 
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying 
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise 
 
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land 
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands 
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high 
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die

Satan's sitting there, he's smiling 
Watches those flames get higher and higher 
Oh no, no, please God help me!

And love comes flowing through 
 
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today 
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way? 
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear? 
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear 
You don't know me you say, but isn't it clear? 
You turn to me in all your wordly greed and pride, 
But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die?."
Black Sabbath,Megalomania,/b/black+sabbath/megalomania_20019448.html,"I hide myself inside the shadows of shame 
The silent symphonies were playing their game 
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul 
This god is something that I could not control 
 
Where can I run to now? 
The joke is on me 
No sympathizing god is insanity, yeah 
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah? 
Why don't you just get out of my life now? 
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now? 
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah? 
 
Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes 
I mixed reality with pseudogod dreams 
The ghost of violence was something I seen 
I sold my soul to be the human obscene 
 
How could this poison be, 
The dream of my soul 
How did my fantasies take complete control, yeah? 
Why don't you just get out of my life, yeah? 
Why don't you just get out of my life now? 
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now? 
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone, yeah? 
 
Well I feel something's taken me I don't know where 
It's like a trip inside a separate mind 
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream 
Is telling me to leave it all behind 
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow 
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow 
 
How I lied, went to hide 
How I tried to get away from you now 
Am I right if I fight? 
That I might just get away from you now 
Sting me! 
 
Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return 
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul 
Beating the demigod, I'm fading away 
I'm going backwards but I'm in control 
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow 
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow 
 
Was it wise to disguise 
How I tried to get away from you now 
Is there a way that I could pay 
Or is it true I have to stay with you now? 
 
How I lied, went to hide 
How I tried to get away from you now 
Am I right if I fight? 
That I might just get away from you now 
Suck me! 
 
I'm really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth 
I've seized my soul in the fires of hell 
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine 
I set the trap, but it was me who fell 
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow 
Now I've found my happiness, providence of sorrow 
 
No more lies, I got wise 
I despise the way I worshipped you yeah 
Now I'm free, can't you see 
And now instead I won't be led by you now 
Free!"

Follow me now and you will not regret 
Leaving the life you led before we met 
You are the first to have this love of mine 
Forever with me 'till the end of time

Black Sabbath,Nightwing,/b/black+sabbath/nightwing_20019356.html,"Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight 
The silence is over, he's shattered the night 
No other hunter has the power or the grace 
He is the master of this place 
 
Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
So listen my friend 
Nightwing flies again 
 
They say he comes for those whose souls are weak 
And call his name upon the wind 
The night is cold and thick with mystery 
Oh I can feel his beating wings 
 
Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
Nightwing flies again 
 
Tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
Nightwing flies again 
 
Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight 
The silence is over, he's shattered the night 
Life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free 
No soul will rest while the hunted run free 
 
So tell every creature of the night 
The kill is around the bend 
Listen my friend 
Nightwing flies again"
Black Sabbath,Peace Of Mind,/b/black+sabbath/peace+of+mind_21064892.html,"I wish somebody would empty my head 
I am so sorry for the things that I've said 
This hopeless feeling that's living inside 
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find 
Some peace of mind 
 
I ain't no hero who's gonna save you 
I just say ""hi"" as I'm passing right through 
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride 
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find 
Some peace of mind 
 
Read in between the lines 
Truth that is neither black nor white 
Black nor white 
Just give me something real 
Broken man still searching for the light 
In the night 
 
Caught In the middle as the front line falls 
It looks like I don't stand a chance 
If only I could turn my life around 
Or is this just the circumstance"
Black Sabbath,Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,/b/black+sabbath/sabbath+bloody+sabbath_20019508.html,"You've seen life through distorted eyes 
You know you had to learn 
The execution of your mind 
You really had to turn 
The race is run the book is read 
The end begins to show 
The truth is out, the lies are old 
But you don't want to know 
 
Nobody will ever let you know 
When you ask the reasons why 
They just tell you that you're on your own 
Fill your head all full of lies 
 
The people who have crippled you 
You want to see them burn 
The gates of life have closed on you 
And now there's just no return 
You're wishing that the hands of doom 
Could take your mind away 
And you don't care if you don't see again 
The light of day 
 
Nobody will ever let you know 
When you ask the reasons why 
They just tell you that you're on your own 
Fill your head all full of lies 
You bastards! 
 
Where can you run to 
What more can you do 
No more tomorrow 
Life is killing you 
Dreams turn to nightmares 
Heaven turns to hell 
Burned out confusion 
Nothing more to tell 
 
Everything around you 
What's it coming to 
God knows as your dog knows 
Bog blast all of you 
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath 
Nothing more to do 
Living just for dying 
Dying just for you"

He drives me crazy, he won't go away 
Playing his game every night and everyday, yeah-ah 
 
My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak 
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep 
Impending doom is what I'm about 
Think I'm going mad without a shadow of doubt 
 
I search for serenity yeah 
Is it really out there? 
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere 
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control

I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no 
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do? 
I wanted you to be my wife 
 
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone 
Your memories are all I have, yes I have 
I sit here waiting but you'll never show 
Without you I can't carry on, oh my baby 
 
You said you'd always love me, all of my life 
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye 
Why the sudden changes, why all the lies? 
I should have seen it in your eyes 
 
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you 
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain 
The silent emptiness of one sided love 
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby"
Black Sabbath,Sins Of The Father,/b/black+sabbath/sins+of+the+father_20019323.html,"I am the crazy man 
Who lives inside your head 
But I think I'm breaking through the wall 
 
You are the innocent 
Convicted of the crime 
No one was ever there 
To catch you when you fall 
 
I see the diamonds 
But you only see the rock 
I need to run 
But you only crawl 
 
It's time to open up 
All the doors that you keep locked 
Nobody gives without a take 
Let's take it all 
 
You've been twisted into pieces 
By the hands of your emotions 
How much longer are you gonna pay 
For yesterday 
Sins of the father 
 
One more crucifixion 
One more cross to bear 
You're a hole in a photograph 
 
Go on lose it in the city 
The city can feel no shame 
See the world with electric eye 
 
They call it mystery 
But any fool could see 
You thought he walked on the water 
 
And if the pain was gone 
And you were free to run away 
And get out 
 
Would you get out of there 
Or do you really care 
It's not safe or easy 
And maybe when you're gone 
You just won't belong at all 
 
You're the only witness 
To the murder of an angel 
How much longer are you gonna pay 
For yesterday 
Sins of the father 
 
It's just another crucifixion 
One more cross to bear 
Go on lose it in the city 
Take a look at the world 
You've got electric eyes"
Black Sabbath,The Writ,/b/black+sabbath/the+writ_20019452.html,"The way I feel is the way I am 
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you 
Just to you 
 
What kind of people do you think we are? 
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you 
Just for you 
 
The faithful image of another man 
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you 
Yeah for you 
 
The shot troopers laying down on the floor 
I wish they'd put an end to my running war with you 
Yeah with you 
 
Are you metal, are you man? 
You've changed in life since you began 
Yeah began 
 
Ladies digging gold from you 
Will they still dig now you're through 
Yeah you're through 
 
You bought and sold me with your lying words 
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through 
Yeah came through 
 
Your folly finally got to spend with a gun 
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you 
Yeah that's you 
 
I beg you please don't let it get any worse 
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you 
Yeah curse you 
 
All of the promises that never came true 
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true 
Ah, that's true 
 
Are you Satan, are you man? 
You've changed in life since it began 
It began 
 
Vultures sucking gold from you 
Will they still suck now you're through 
 
(Cats, Rats) 
 
The search is on, so you just better run 
And find yourself another way 
Probably dead, they don't feel a thing 
To keep them living for another day 
 
(Rats, Rat) 
 
You are nonentity, you have no destiny 
You are a victim of a thing unknown 
A mantle picture of a stolen soul 
A fornication of your golden throne 
 
A smiling face, it means the world to me 
So tired of sadness and of misery 
 
My life it started some time ago 
Where it will end, I don't know 
I thought I was so good 
I thought I was fine 
I feel my world is out of time 
 
But everything is gonna work out fine 
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind 
 
I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know 
Listen to me while I sing this song 
You might just think the words are wrong 
Too many people advising me 
But they don't know what my eyes see 
 
But everything is gonna work out fine"
Black Sabbath,Under The Sun,/b/black+sabbath/under+the+sun_20272607.html,"Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to 
Tell me what it's all about 
No black magician telling me 
To cast my soul out 
Don't believe in violence 
I don't even believe in peace 
I've opened the door 
Now my mind has been released 
 
Well I don't want no preacher 
Telling me about the god in the sky 
No I don't want no one to tell me 
Where I'm gonna go when I die 
I wanna live my life, I don't want 
People telling me what to do 
I just believe in myself 
'Cause no one else seems true 
 
Every day just comes and goes 
Life is one long overdose 
People try to rule the nation 
I can see through their frustration 
 
People riding their real peace 
keep on running their rat race 
Behind each flower there grows a weed 
In their world of make-believe 
 
So believe what I tell you 
It's the only way to fight in the end 
Just believe in yourself you know you really 
shouldn't have to pretend 
Don't let those empty people 
Try and interfere with your mind 
Just live your life 
And leave them all behind"
